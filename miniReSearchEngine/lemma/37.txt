Does the device need to simply turn on or do it need to boot up all the way ? For instance , when my iPad get very low on battery ( which happens frequently when travel ) , it power on immediately but only flash a `` low battery '' message and icon . It do n't boot all the way . Would this pas inspection ? Thanks ! July 8 , 2014 at 8:38 PM Anonymous say ... How will non-battery operate electronics be deal with ?

Go to http : //gearpatrol.com/2013/03/14/die-hard-drives-5-best-rugged-drives/ to get a sense of what such a device look like . It 's big than a phone , and have no screen . At most it have an LED light to show it 's on . Will the light go on be sufficient ? And if so , do n't that point out the lunacy of this policy , that a light which require nearly no power to turn on be sufficient evidence that a large electronic device be indeed what the traveler purport it to be and that it have n't be tamper with ?

July 9 , 2014 at 7:47 AM Anonymous say ... I question the effectiveness of this policy . Should n't you be able to see if something be n't right with these electronics with the x-ray machine ? Even if you ca n't see if something be wrong , would n't the terrorist just make it so the device could power on normally ? If not , would n't they just make it so the power button be the detonator ? In that case , a densely pack checkpoint would be destroy instead of a plane . What happens to the electronics that ca n't be power up ? Will a passenger be allow to leave the checkpoint to ship or check the device ? Will a passenger be allow to plug it in at the checkpoint to try to turn it on ? Will it just be toss in the garbage along with all of the other dangerous liquid ? July 9 , 2014 at 9:07 AM Anonymous say ... `` Curious if there 's any science behind this , at all '' If it 's TSA , there 's no science . These be the same folk who be still lie about `` explosive liquid '' eight year after overseas law enforcement broke up a pirely aspirational plot by a bunch of loser who do n't even have airplane ticket .

Very confusing . This be akin to most law or policy . Whether researched or not , they appear to be not research and hastily pass . Very good question here . What about external hard drive ? What about battery backup ? Battery backup be just that , a large battery for the purpose of recharge on a long flight . But some be large and may arouse suspicion . I just call the TSA help line and they do n't seem to know . Any thought ? July 9 , 2014 at 10:45 AM Anonymous say ... I think that all of the above that do n't like the policy or have concern , should take the train or Boat ! ! ! ! July 9 , 2014 at 10:49 AM SSSS for Some Reason say ... Yes . Because everyone know a fully charge batter be so much safer than an discharged battery . Can the TSA explain in any way the reason for this bit of security theater ? And while you compose your carefully word non-answer let me deflect you away from what will be the obvious answer ... . A laptop battery , for example , be about so-big . An equal amount of explosive will look like a battery on the x-ray machine . OK , fine ... . power up the laptop to make sure it be a battery and not a bomb . But ... . There be , believe it or not , a lot of empty space inside of a laptop , plenty of space to put in the bad stuff AND still leave the battery in place . Or ... . A small batter that will power up the screen and keep it run for a minute or three with a slightly small amount of bad stuff . Or ... . Not even bother with the laptop idea and just just pack the power supply with bad stuff . It be a big space , be already heavy , and unless you be provide a main to plug into be go to go relatively unnoticed . Or ... . you do n't check baggage . At least not to anything anyone would call a secure standard . So why would n't the bad guy simply check their bomb in the luggage with a timer ? And I 'm not even a bad guy and I just think up three way to get around your silly request to power on electronics . You have to go away TSA . You need to follow the same model a the FAA ... . you write the standard that others have to follow and get out of the business of provide the actual security because you have prove time and time again that you ca n't do it effectively . At all . July 9 , 2014 at 11:04 AM Anonymous say ... I 'm surprise this be n't a standard inspection already . If a seemingly electronic device be not able to power up and be functional , then it be n't what it appear to be . It be hubris to assume that a terrorist ( homegrown or otherwise ) be not creative and gift with intelligence . July 9 , 2014 at 11:24 AM RB say ...

July 9 , 2014 at 11:55 AM __________ RB , TSA can not mandate what technology airline or foreign airport use to screen people/property . They have to enure that they meet security level and to do that they have to find the `` low tech '' way to do so . Plus , this be an early roll out . To assume that all airport around the world have ETD machine be slightly silly . July 9 , 2014 at 1:34 PM SSSS for Some Reason say ... `` ... Anonymous say ... I think that all of the above that do n't like the policy or have concern , should take the train or Boat ! ! ! ! '' Yes ! Because we should all have to give up something so fundamental a travelling just so you can feel comfortable and safe . Would n't you prefer to have actual security ? Something that actually make you safe ? Would n't you prefer to choose the more adult model and take responsibility for your own safety instead of hand that responsibility over to a bunch of folk that have silly policy like take water away from you because it might be dangerous but who then throw it in a giant bin next to the checkpoint because it not like it be dangerous or anything ... ... July 9 , 2014 at 2:13 PM Eastern Sunset say ... What happens to the confiscate phone and other electronic device ? July 9 , 2014 at 2:43 PM Anonymous say ... The TSA put this vague statement out , but refuse to address any of the question that follow . That make me think that they do n't think this policy through and have no answer . I 'll tell you one thing ; if a TSA agent try to confiscate any of my electronic equipment , we will have very big problem . July 9 , 2014 at 3:22 PM Anonymous say ... Still , the terrorist be ahead of TSA . The security hole may be fix in electronics but the terrorist be implant explosive on suicidal terrorist , either in body cavity or surgically . Time to utilise full body cavity search on all passenger and crew and disallow anyone with healing scar from travel . America have to get serious about security . July 9 , 2014 at 9:39 PM Anonymous say ... Secretary Johnson 's statement that you link to say ABSOLUTELY NOTHING about electronic device . So why then do your blog post have `` Electronic Devices '' in the title ? If there be a directive regarding electronic device , please provide the correct link . Otherwise , stop mislead the public with unofficial statement about electronic device . Where be the official statement FROM SECRETARY JOHNSON that say `` Powerless device will not be permit onboard the aircraft '' .

How will you clear battery case , such a these ? http : //www.macworld.com/article/2045268/review-best-battery-cases-for-the-iphone-5.html The entire device be a battery , and the battery by itself have no way of indicate that it 's actually on .

I saw a story on NBC last night that say some people on US domestic flight will have to power on their device . It sound like this program be be expand . Will everyone fly in the US have to power on their device eventually ? What happens to device that ca n't power up ? Does a passenger get to leave screening to mail or check the device ? For some reason I see a bunch of screener take home a lot of expensive electronics . If someone do n't take them home , I hope such dangerous device be n't allow to be throw in an ordinary trash can like so many dangerous water bottle . July 10 , 2014 at 10:01 AM Anonymous say ...

July 10 , 2014 at 9:01 AM _______________________________ If you read the CFR it be not the country who be responsible for screening , but the airline who be responsible . The screening can be do by the airline , at the gate for example , or the country can take over that security procedure for the airline . The TSA be not tell country what to do . It be tell AIRLINES who fly in and out of the U.S. what to do . They can do this by law because the TSA regulate these company . I be a nerd and like reading Codes of Federal Regulations .

It look like the TSA be change it rule so if someone show up at an airport and you demand he turn on his phone , and it wo n't power up , that the TSA will NOT allow the flyer to go put it in his car , give it to a friend , mail it , etc . Instead , the TSA will immediately confiscate the phone . Operations Directive 400.5 , aka SEL-001 http : //flyingwithfish.boardingarea.c ... s-whos-behind/ Any comment from the Team ?

July 10 , 2014 at 6:31 PM Anonymous say ... Everybody : Configure a password/gesture/keycode security on your phone , tablet , laptop , etc , so that your desktop/homescreen be _not_ visible upon power up or `` swiping '' of the screen after power up . As of the supreme court decision about device search require a search warrant , anything that a pretend-LEO or actual LEO see will be use to justify an `` justifiable suspicion '' search ( read : unwarranted and illegal ) search of your electronic device . This be because once they see your desktop/screen , your entire device qualifies a `` unlock '' and therefore `` in plain view '' searchable container . Screenshot take .

I have mention several reason in the past of why the TSA be security theater . The first and foremost reason be the apparent lack of any risk analysis . One have to take into an account how likely an event be to occur , the cost of the event occur , and the cost to prevent the event from occur . Terrorism be a very rare event . Preventing terrorism be worthwhile , but because of the rarity , not at the current price ( both monetary and other ) . And yes , I have a blog ( I 've link to it in the past ) , but I currently do not cover security on it . July 16 , 2014 at 4:47 AM Anonymous say ... What about a personal vibrator ?

I know people who have board plane with knife and one fellow who board not once but twice with a folding camp saw that could cut a man 's head off .
