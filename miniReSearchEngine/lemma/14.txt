The carbon tax will begin at a fix price of $ 23 per tonne of carbon dioxide emit into the atmosphere . Cloaked by the lie and deception of the science that have persuade the Australian Government that climate change be real , the Globalists have now begin to change the fundamental structure of the boom Australian economy . The real cost of a carbon tax on the Australian economy and how it will affect Australian family directly be hidden by the Globalists and the Australian Government when they be sell the carbon tax to the Australian public . Now that Australia be about to introduce aGlobalistcarbon tax , Australian business have begin to change the way they do business in Australia and this be now impact ordinary Australians . Firstly , the immediate impact of a carbon tax will be felt by charitable organization . The Salvation Army , one of Australias large charitable organization , have reveal that a carbon tax will cost them an additional $ 3.5 million dollar and that this could impact on the service they provide to about 300,000 people a year of which include emergency accommodation and drug and alcohol counseling . Secondly , to make matter even bad for charitable organisation and ordinary Australians , electricity company be refuse to tell struggle family and business exactly how much the carbon tax will add to their power bill . The Australian federal government estimate electricity price will increase by up to 10 per cent when the tax kick in on July 1 , 2012 , however there have be report that electricity price will in fact increase by up to 20 % and more . In Canberra , the cost of electricity be set to increase by about $ 244 per household , or almost 20 per cent , with the Federal Governments carbon tax make up more than 75 per cent of the jump . Thirdly , and even more disturbing , be the fact that the introduction of this ; Globalist-backed carbon tax will make Australia one of the most uncompetitive country in the world . At the moment , Australian business already pay 130 percent more for electricity than Canadians , accord to new research , which will rise to 250 percent once the carbon tax and locked-in price increase take effect . The average New South Wales household annual cost for electricity would fall from $ 1700 to less than $ 700 if their price be the same a in Canada . Finally , not only will the cost of living go up ; the cost of do business in Australia will go up and result in a nation-wide wage freeze . It have be recently report that the Australian Industry Group ( AIG ) have ask Fair Work Australia ( Australias workplace industrial tribunal ) to restrict the next rise in the minimum wage to $ 14 a week , less than the rate of inflation . There be also many unconfirmed report that negotiation between employee and employer in large Australian corporation ( Telstra , BHP and Rio Tinto for example ) have already begin to factor in the cost of the carbon tax for their next set of enterprise agreement . So where be the Australian Government receiving most of it advice about the suppose effect of climate change , and why Australia need a carbon tax ? The suppose authoritative voice come from a man name Tim Flannery , who be Australias Chief Climate Commissioner . Tim Flannery , a self-proclaimed Globalist and another supporter of global government , be appoint to the position of Chief Climate Commissioner only because he share the same misguide belief about climate change a do the leader of the Australian Greens party Bob Brown ( Self proclaim globalist and supporter of global government ) and the leader of the Australian Labor party , Julia Gillard . Unbelievably , Tim Flannery have be catch on record exaggerate the supposed effect of climate change . Over the past 5 year , he have be record a say : ( Remember , this man be advise the Australian Government about issue pertain around climate change ) Picture an eight-storey building by a beach , then imagine wave lap it roof . ( The Age , 2006 ) Anyone with a coastal view from their bedroom window , or their kitchen window , or wherever , be likely to lose their house a a result of that change , so anywhere , any coastal city , coastal area , be in grave danger . ( WWF interview , 2007 ) I think there be a fair chance Perth will be the 21st century first ghost metropolis . Its whole primary production be in dire strait . ( The Sydney Morning Herald , 2004 ) The water problem be so severe for Adelaide that it may run out of water by early 2009 . ( Jetstar magazine , 2008 ) . Adelaides water storage be now 53 per cent full . What future do the Australian economy have and how can we expect the Australian people to continue to prosper when one of the most influential Australian Globalists , Tim Flannery , be advise the Australian Government about climate change and why Australia need a carbon tax ? There have also be debate though the community that the introduction of a carbon tax might be unconstitutional . According to the Institute of Public Affairs ( IPA ) , the introduction of a carbon tax may actually be unconstitutional because carbon dioxide emission be state property which cant be tax by the Commonwealth Government of Australia . They claim that the Commonwealth Government of Australia cant impose a carbon tax and related penalty within the same piece of legislation nor use the external affair power of the Australian constitution . All Globalist -backed carbon tax initiative should only be regard a transfer payment from your pocket to the pocket of theGlobalistelite , large corporation and government . A carbon tax will not make one single digit of improvement to global air quality , climate change ( if it real ) and will make any country that adopts a carbon tax uncompetitive and destine to fail . If your federal or local government be about to introduce a carbon tax , get them to look at how much it be go to affect the Australian economy and dont stay silent on the issue .

As an Australian it should be note after reading this piece that the Gillard Government ( current federal government ) , be head for electoral oblivion at the next election . The prime minister Juliar Gillard ( now know a JuLiar ) , be grossly unpopular , have be prove in many instance to be a liar and fraud and will be note in Australian political history a the PM that destroy not only the federal labor party but also demonstrate how corrupt , ignorant and arrogant a governemtn can be . On the positive side it wll also demonstrate the power of the people by the destruction of this political party by the voter . For those that dont know the PM state only day before the last election in very clear concise language that `` I will not introduce a carbon tax '' , this statement alone lead her to claim victory and come to power . It go to show how some people will do anything for power . April 11 , 2012 at 2:05 PM Anonymous say ... This be nonsense ! April 11 , 2012 at 2:06 PM Anonymous say ...

April 11 , 2012 at 6:29 PM Freedom Fighter say ... So the Liebour Party be out at the next election . Will the incoming party repeal the Zionist-NWO-One-World-Government-Communist carbon tax ? I dont think so . The devil remain in power , only his mask be change . Australians deserve this anyway . They spend all their spare time watch childrens game like footy and cricket and be incapable of real political thought and analysis . The ancient Greeks coin the term idiot for one who be incapable of contribute to or understand ideology , i.e . politics . IOW , Australians be just idiot . April 11 , 2012 at 6:59 PM Anonymous say ... What a joke , it a round robin exercise in futility The Govt take money from the electricity company , the electricity company pass that on to the consumer , the govt gimes `` some '' of the tax back to the consumer , who give it to the electricity company . The only change , be money change hand , with the govt skim a bit out for themselves . Keeping in mind Australias project population growth will wipe out any carbon `` saving '' this tax allegedly make . The labour party no longer exists in queenland , they lose the state election so badly they no longer qualify a a political party . Bring on the next federal election , and we 'll bury them in canberra too . RIP the ALP April 11 , 2012 at 7:08 PM Bernie of Melbourne say ... Hey Freedom Fighter , please not one brush for all . I 'm an Aussie and I hate footy and cricket ( and golf a well ) . One correction to the article however . Gillard do not believe in AGW , or so I 've deduce . She 's just a gutless twit with zero principle and care only about hold on to power . She 's stuff up everything she 's touched , she lie routinely and never answer a straight question . This carbon tax be the height of insanity yet she always present it as a doorway to a great big beautiful new clean-energy world . And we 're stuck with this idiot for another eighteen month .

If your reading this on a devise that have WiFi , then you have to thank the team at the CSIRO in Australia . Now back to the post ... I think Bernie of Melbourne have say it perfectly `` This carbon tax be the height of insanity '' . Only insane politician and their `` crazy moral belief '' would concoct such a crazy scheme . April 11 , 2012 at 8:37 PM Anonymous say ... Nolan 's transport ( last year `` Business of the Year '' award winner ) in Gatton , Queensland be one of Gillard 's 500 company earmark to pay the $ 23 per ton . They have be deem to be responsible for 144,700 odd ton of carbon in one year . This would amount to a payment over $ 3.3 million per year and would break the company along with their 265 employee . Their contract could easily then go to small transport operator who do not pay the levy ( those under 25000 ton ) and exactly the same amount of carbon would be produce . This be just another example of the stupidity of this Labour Govt . Do n't scoff Bob Katter Australians ! He be a politically harden passionate patriot who will stop the carbon tax , CSG fracking , and restore our farm just for starter . READ HIS POLICIES ! We have be watch USA GOP electoral fraud and see Juliar and Obama walk arm in arm . We need Bob Katter like the US need Ron Paul . April 11 , 2012 at 9:51 PM Anonymous say ...

I think that the Ctax be deliberately design to bring down the only economy to survive the GFC , and ANY sacrifice - include political party - will be make to achieve it . Co2 be only 2 % of the atmosphere , and only 2 % of that 2 % be man-made CO2 . And Australia only contribute 2 % of the 2 % of the 2 % . BTW there be NO scientific definition that state that CO2 be a pollutant . But tax `` Carbon '' be a great way to tax Nature be n't it ! ? Viva revolution ! ! Let the game begin .

It 's wonderful living in Australia in many way but when it come to the `` Climate Change '' debate it 's not easy . The medium be extremely bias & will shoot down anyone who try to question the science & not give them fair airing . People who question it be make to look stupid . There 's a lot of bullying go on & a lot of deliberate propaganda . Which make it very difficult to discuss it socially even because people have be sell that rubbish . Economically the country have be do extremely well consider all that 's be go on , but with this Carbon Tax the uncertainty be rise . I myself be struggle a bit at the moment a it be & I 'm not excite at all about our electricity bill go up soon . It 's go to send some people under I 'm sure . Julia Gillard ca n't be trust but then so many people swallow the party line . The medium pick their favourite when it come to politics a well . I 'm very suspicious about where the `` carbon tax '' money be go to go . If you can at all avoid going down the road of a `` carbon tax '' then fight it . I know here it will just make the poor , poorer . April 16 , 2012 at 2:46 AM Anonymous say ... It be good to see that the Gillard/Green Govt will achieve it role of reduce Australias carbon footprint quicker than anyone in the world could ever imagine . Think about it , the Carbon Tax in conjunction with the Mining Tax These be the two piece of legislation that not only will bring or economy to it knee but at the same time raise cost in all aspect of manufacturing . Manufacturing / production require two thing , raw material and electricity . One of the large consumer of electricity outside of domestic be manufacture and mining . Steel plant , aluminium smelter mine operation all require electricity and if you be a miner you have hit a double whammy Carbon tax and mining tax ! Lucky Lucky Lucky . ( As a side note I bring up mine tax for one very good reason , and it not that I be against tax , the ALL company be require to pay tax on profit , and that be a good thing . Not only that but mine company must also pay royalty to Australia for the raw material they extract , this be also a good thing . If the Govt really want to do it part and give Australians a big slice of the mining boom then they should have change the royalty structure , this would have achieve exactly the same result . Instead it introduce a tax which on the surface be only applicable to the mining sector but when you dig deep can be use against any sector of manufacturing that profit from work in Australia i.e . Farming , manufacturing and yes any small business that have a building on Australian soil . While this be not the immediate aim of the legislation it can , and will , be massage over time to achieve this goal . Face it , everybody hat those big company that make million of dollar so if they can all be single out easily then no one would complain if they be tax heavily would they ? Oh I forget , these be the company that manufacture the raw material for housing , dig up the copper that go into make electrical cable and those pesky farmer that bring you all the fresh fruit , veg , milk and meat.. ) ( a a side , side note , if no one have guess already the Gillard Govt need the mining tax desperately for one reason only , it the only way they could ever have expect to get the country back into surplus after they throw away the 26 Billion dollar surplus when they come into power ! This be why it so important to their Govt , no other reason . It would have take too long to fiddle with royalty to achieve the same goal and this give them future ability to increase the tax scope in one fell swoop . ) I use to own my own company , I build it from the ground up and without any Govt help whatsoever , and I can say from experience that cost WILL go up dramatically . A a manufacturer you must look at the best way to minimise cost while try to keep your head above water . I be not talk about the massive company that make ten of million of dollar a year ( they have to as well ) but those that make 10M or less a year and be scatter throughout the country to keep it run . Their raw material cost be go to go through the roof along with the price of electricity , fuel , water etc etc ... and a a result some will be force to close their door and move offshore while others will just simply shut down . Part 1 EL April 17 , 2012 at 11:05 AM Anonymous say ... Part 2 El But this be not a bad thing , with the closing of more and more business will come the inevitable loss of job . With the loss of job will come the reduce interest ( By those who use to work and be responsible people ) in the little luxury such a electricity , food etc . that we have all come to love and enjoy and a a result we will produce less carbon..win win for everyone . Here be a question you need to ask yourself , when have ANY Govt given you any money back ( on mass ) and not want triple back in return ? ? ? ? The answer be never . Do you really think that any treasurer in their right mind would ever give back BILLIONS to the tax payer and not have a way to get it all back with interest ? If you do then seek helpreally , you need to right now . I be all for clean living but we have a really big problem here , YES we need to reduce our carbon footprint , YES we should be lead the world by example but NOT AS A POLITICAL STUNT ! ! The reduction need to be do in a sustainable way that do not destroy our economy . It take careful planning and clear head . I like many Australians have instal solar panel for power and solar hot water . I have also commission a 80,000L water tank so I do not use any water from the council . We produce enough electricity to 100 % offset our power and also fee back into the grid . So tell me how many more Aussies be out there do the same ? And of those that cant afford to would in a heartbeat if the Govt make it easy ? The issue of global warming be big than one tax that be intend to force Big Companies to be more efficient . The problem be the make of every single person on earth and it will take ALL of u to make a difference . Taxing for the solution be not the way to achieve the require outcome . Incentives ( not cash incentive ) be what should be use and more importantly EDUCATION . It be the next generation of people on this earth that will make the difference . If they be educate and have the incentive to work to a solution they will find one without destroying the country in the process . Australian engineer and researcher be the most sought after commodity around the world and receive the high respect , Australia should be do everything in it power to entice our best mind to stay and work here to solve our issue a well a the world need .
