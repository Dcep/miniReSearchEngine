No . There 's no power surge when you turn on a light . Turning the light off ALWAYS save electricity , even if it 's for just a second . ( more on light ... ) Does it take more energy to turn on a computer than to leave it on ? No . There 's no meaningful power surge when you turn on a computer . Turning the computer off ALWAYS save electricity . Of course , you can also use the power saver feature . ( more on computer ... ) Is there ANY consumer device that use more energy when you turn it on than when it 's already on ? No , not in practical term . I do n't believe you . Everyone say there 's a surge when you turn on computer and stuff . There 's a surge but it 's so tiny you ca n't easily measure it . That 's because it happen for only a fraction of a second , and the surge itself be modest . It 's certainly not cost you any extra money , not even a penny . So there 's no surge in practical term . As far a you 're concern there 's no surge at all . Think of it this way : If a device use twice a much power a normal for one full second when you turn it on , that would mean that it cost you one whole extra second of electricity . Big deal . That 's a fraction of a fraction of a fraction of a penny . And in fact , the surge do n't really last for a whole second , it last for only a fraction of a second , and the surge be n't close to twice a much power a normal , it 's much less . Bottom line : Surge be so incredibly insignificant it 's really like there be no surge at all , for all intent and purpose . There be never a penalty for turn on a household device . Does it take more energy to cool a house in which the AC have be off all day , than to keep the AC run at , say , 85 degree during the day ? No . Cooling a hot house down at the end of the day always take less energy than leave the AC running all day , even if it 's run on a high setting . ( more on cool ... ) Does a 240V device use more electricity than the same device design to run off 120V ? No . The electric company charge you for watt-hour , not volt , and the wattage be the same . To figure volt you use the fomula V x Amps = Watts . A device that use twice a many volt will use half a many amp , so the wattage will be the same -- and so will the cost . Electricity Facts I hear that an electrical wire problem can lead to electricity `` leak '' out of the wire and into the abyss , cause a person to pay for electricity that they don't use . Yes , this be a possible . Note that on an early version of this page , I mistakenly list this one a a Myth , but an electrician correct me . When the wiring be n't connect correctly , it be indeed possible for electricity to `` leak '' . The electrician who contact me have a customer with a $ 15/mo . leak due to faulty wire . On another page I have detail instruction on how to check for this kind of electricity leak . Besides mis-wiring , you could also have undersized wire , where the wiring be too thin to handle the load be drive . When that happens the wire heat up . The extra heat generate represents waste energy , but more importantly , the extra heat can cause a fire which can burn your house down . If you have a modern home which have an electrical inspection when it be build then it 's unlikely that your wiring be inadequate . But if you have an old home or your wire be never inspect when instal , it 's possible that your wire be n't sufficient for what you 're run through it . Unfortunately this be n't the kind of thing you can easily test yourself . That 's a job for a competent electrician .
