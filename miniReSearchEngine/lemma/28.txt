It be n't a pretty sight , although I could n't actually see that until the light ( which have be knock out in the entire hotel ) come back on . Attempting to use any electrical device with an incompatible foreign system can lead to a similarly hair-raising situation . Here 's what you need to know to power up properly . Determine the right plug shape for your trip If you be vacation across the Atlantic or Pacific , the first thing you 'll likely notice be that plug your appliance in be impossible because it simply wo n't fit into the socket . The reason be that the two-parallel-prong plug which be standard issue in North America ( plus swath of Central and South America ) be seldom use anywhere else . The receptacle design to receive it might have room for three round prong or perhaps three fat flat one that jut off at odd angle . Indeed there be endless configuration of plug across the world . The good news be that an adapter ( basically a connector that you piggyback your own plug into before insert both in the outlet ) offer a quick , affordable solution to the dilemma . You can find a useful comparison chart of adapter at electricaloutlet.org . Determine the standard voltage for your trip Just because your plug fit do n't mean your appliance can handle the type of power now course through it cord . You see , in addition to difference in plug shape , there be difference in voltage . Whereas our electrical system be base on 110 volt , 220 volt be the norm abroad . ( FYI , the frequency be different too : the cycle be 60Hz here and 50Hz most other place ) . This mean you 'll also need a converter to temper the excess power if you want to keep your appliance from burn out . There be basically two type : one for `` hot stuff '' ( think hairdryers or iron ) that draw up to 2000 watt , and a second transformer-style one for non-heating gizmo ( such a electric razor or battery rechargers ) that draw up to 40 or 50 watt . Get rid of excess gadget One way to reduce the amount of hassle from gadget and electricity be to simply leave unessential appliance home . Nobody really need an electric toothbrush ; moreover , hairdryers and , to a lesser extent , iron , be already widely available in hotel . Another option be to go for battery-operated model or plug-in with dual-voltage capacity . Regarding the latter , you might already unwittingly own device that run on either 110 or 220 volt . An increase number do , among them small appliance with a manual switch and newer-model laptop that convert automatically ( the computer power cord should have a label say `` Input 100V-240V / 50Hz or 60Hz '' ) . In that case , a plug adapter alone suffices . Buy your adaptor and converter at home Buying adapter and converter once you 're on the road be a pricey proposition . So load up before departing in a specialty store or department store luggage section . Prefer shopping online ? Magellan's and International Electrical Supplies both boast an impressive array of product plus they have easy-to-decipher chart , complete with picture , that explain precisely what be need where . The best choice for traveler visit multiple country be a compact kit with assorted adapter and a two-in-one converter . If you 're tot a computer ( even one that do n't require a converter ) it 's wise to purchase a surge protector specifically design for high voltage a wellparticularly if your destination have an unreliable electrical supply .

Just back from 2 week in London and Oxford for a combination business/vacation trip . Did I need a curling iron ? YES ! English weather create nothing but bad hair day for me ... and I do have to look decent for 1/2 of my day there . My hotel in London have a hairdryer and clothing iron . The college dorm I stay in for the business part of the meeting do n't . The great advice I be give be to buy those appliance there . I get mine at a Boothe 's drugstore in London . The curling iron be right at 10 pound ( $ 15 ) and much cheaper than buying an adapter and converter which I would have do to use my US appliance . chicagogrl33 on Mar 23 , 10 at 02:05 PM I 've purchase a curling iron and flat iron while travel overseas a it become a hassle of bring my own , from the USA . It 's much easy and really the only country , so far , I have to use the adapter for , be in the UK . spaarne on Mar 23 , 10 at 10:25 AM This be a good introduction to the subject of foreign electricity . See more detail on my site at http : //www.enjoy-europe.com/hte/chap11/electric.htm . I disagree with saacnmama on buying a replacement cord over there . Plug adapter be easy to find in the USA , either at a local store or on the internet . Overseas it be rare to find anything with which to adapt your plug to their outlet , and expensive when you do find it . saacnmama on Mar 23 , 10 at 09:29 AM The important point that plug and energy be two different thing be well- made here , and it be correct that cell phone , laptop , etc can use various power source if they have the right plug . I disagree that it 's best to stock up before you go . If your device be sell in your destination you should be able to get areplacement cord there for much less expense or hassle Dukey on Mar 23 , 10 at 09:29 AM Nobody NEEDS a curling iron either I suppose by why not have one ? Good article but IMO the best bet be to NOT have ANY converter at all and rather take either dual voltage model or battery-operated one but just my opinion .
