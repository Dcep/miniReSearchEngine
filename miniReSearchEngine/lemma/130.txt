Circuit Monitoring Building a Home Power Monitoring System Introduction | Planning | Installation | Software | Wisdom Introduction Have you ever wonder how much power that microwave take to pop that bag of popcorn ? What about your toaster or coffee maker ? How much power do that 'energy efficient ' refrigerator actually use ? And do it really make a difference if you turn all those light off all the time ? The problem with wondering about this stuff be there be n't really much you can do to measure it . Sure you can use a meter to measure an individual device here and there , but what do your whole house look like ? About a year ago I be hire to develop a web base power monitor application for data center . The application be design to monitor thousand of individual branch circuit use current transducer at the breaker panel . Among other thing , the data log requirments be to provide one year of min/max/mean measurement data with one minute resolution per circuit . Since I have all the hardware for testing , I figure what good way to test thing than to install it in my own home . I 'm a software guy by trade , but have do my fair share of home improvement project ( How to build a ceiling dome ) and other construction hack ( Building a trade show booth on a budget ) . I figure wire current transducer to my breaker panel would be a quick little project that would yield all kind of really interesting data about my house ... in effect provide me with a 'sniffer ' for my electrical network . A couple of warning however ... DO N'T try this at home unless you know what you 're do . Aside from be electrocute , incorrect wiring can burn your house down . If you think this be cool and try to do something similar on you
