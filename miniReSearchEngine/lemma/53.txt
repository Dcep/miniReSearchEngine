The evaporators metal fin exchange the thermal energy with the air around it . There , the refrigerant turn from liquid into vapor , remove any heat from the surround air . As the heat be remove from the air , the air be cool and blown back into the house . From that point , the condenser or outdoor unit then turn the refrigerant vapor back into a liquid , remove any heat .
