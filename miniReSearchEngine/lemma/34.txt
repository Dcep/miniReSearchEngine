But if you 're not aware of the new pool-pump regulation that go into effect the first day of 2012 , you could find yourself in troubled water . The Arizona Legislature recently pass new energy-efficiency standard for residential pool pump and portable electric spa . Led by a similar law in California and other state , the pool-building industry for year have be try to design and build pool that use less energy . So how do this new law affect pool owner ? While it do n't mean you need to run out and change your in-ground pool and spa motor immediately , it do require any newly instal pump of at least one horsepower or great to meet the new standard . Dual-speed , multiple-speed or variable-speed pump will be the minimum efficiency for pool-pump installation move forward , and inefficient single-speed pump no longer will be allow in new installation . PHOTOS : Cool Home : Best Pools and Spas The culprit : Single-speed pump work fine for simply circulate pool water . However , they do n't efficiently harness enough power to run your pool cleaner , waterfall or other electrical extra that need an occasional , big blast of energy . If you 're run a pump with only one speed , it 's always on -- run full-blast even when your pool cleaner and waterfall be n't operate . There 's no option to dial back to a low level of energy while it 's in use ( for example : when all you need be to circulate the water , which be most of the time ) . That 's a huge waste of energy , and it 's cost you about 90 percent more in electric bill than you should be pay . The good news : You may not know that your pool pump us more electricity than any other appliance in your house except your air-conditioner . You also may not know that most pool be equip with pump that be too big and use way more energy than you need to keep the water sparkle clean . The new regulation will ultimately help homeowner save money over time . Manufacturers claim variable-speed pump can cut energy use by up to 90 percent compare with single-speed pump . Craig O'Grady , who own Desert Sun Pools in Phoenix , say his customer who already have make the switch report save $ 300 or more a year on their electric bill . `` The variable-speed , in my opinion , be the way to go , '' say O'Grady . `` They 're quieter and have a lot of great attribute . Mostly , there 's incredible saving for homeowner . After the first three year , you 're go to save a considerable amount of money . Some of my customer be only pay $ 100 per year , and some a low a $ 55 . That 's an incredible saving . '' The bad news . Although the general public really be just learn about the new regulation , there 's already quite a bit of criticism come from the pool industry . First , the standard will require consumer to purchase pricey , energy-efficient upgrade for any pump they replace . On average , the cost to make the switch can be about $ 1,200 to $ 1,400 for part and installation . `` It 's ultimately a good thing for the homeowner , though , '' O'Grady say . `` You 'll recoup the money you spend in three year . After that , you 're go to be save a lot of money . '' Second , some license pool professional , include O'Grady , be upset there be n't any enforcement plan or penalty in place for pool company that try to skirt the law and install single-speed pump . The lack of punishment for unlicensed pool company that do n't follow the law could give rise to unlicensed service technician skirt the law and may draw customer away from rule-abiding pool professional . Another criticism be that pump upgrade often entail more than a straight swap . For example , if customer have old automation system , they have to pay to upgrade their entire board . Rebates . Both SRP and APS be offer rebate to customer who make the upgrade . Basically , both be offer a $ 200 rebate on all newly manufacture variable-speed pump and $ 100 back on dual-speed model . If you go with the dual-speed model , you 'll also need to purchase a timer or control board -- a second piece of equipment that 's capable of switching motor speed automatically . An additional $ 75 rebate be be offer -- one per household -- when you purchase one of these newly manufacture seasonal timer . Call your utility provider or visit aps.com or srpnet.com for detail about how to take advantage of rebate be offer where you live . Also , get together with your pool professional before make any purchase to ensure you 're take advantage of the rebate properly . More way to save . 1 . Sign up with your electric utility for a time-of-use rate plan . APS and SRP offer them . You 'll pay a reduce rate for electricity if you run your pool pump and other appliance , such a your dishwasher or wash machine , during hour of the day when demand for electricity be n't at it peak . Example : SRP will cut your `` off-peak '' rate from the standard 11 cent per kilowatt-hour ( a measure of electricity use ) to about 6.5 cent if you run your pool pump and other appliance from 8 p.m. to 1 p.m. during the summer . If you run the device between 1 p.m. and 8 p.m. , you 'll pay more to use the same electricity . SRP estimate time-of-use-plan customer save up to 7 percent on their electric bill . 2 . Run your pool pump less . It 's not necessary to run it round-the-clock . Most manufacturer recommend run it between eight and 10 hour a day in the summer and about half that in the winter . 3 . Put a timer on the pump so it automatically shut off after those hour , and set it to run only when you 're pay off-peak rate . 4 . Switch to LEDs , which use up to 75 percent less energy than your traditional incandescent underwater light . LEDs last for year and come in multiple color . 5 . Keep your chemical in balance . Doug Sydenham of Postorino Pool Service & Repair in Scottsdale say it cost about $ 125 to have a pool service come out and test the level of `` total dissolve solid , '' such a calcium , in the water and determine whether you need to drain and refill your pool . 6 . Clean trap basket , filter and pool wall and floor regularly . Clogged basket and filter can prevent the water from flow freely and will slow your filter . The harder the pump have to work to keep the pool clean , the more you 'll pay to run it . For more do-it-yourself tip , go to rosieonthehouse.com .
