View photo FILE - In this Saturday , Jan. 10 , 2009 , file photo , a flock of geese fly past a smokestack at the Jeffery Energy Center coal power plant near Emmitt , Kan. Economic force , pollution concern and competition from clean fuel be slowly nudge nation around the globe away from coal . ( AP Photo/Charlie Riedel , File ) Give him credit for try . With Congress lock in a state of disputatious paralysis , President Obama have once again resort to executive action to address a national problem . New rule propose by the Environmental Protection Agency will significantly reduce carbon emission , mark a first step toward seriously address climate change by the world lead economy . The new rule will remake the U.S. power sector , however , which mean there will be winner and loser . Consumers could end up in both category . An EPA analysis of the complex regulation claim the typical consumer 's electricity bill will fall by 8 % , on average , by 2030 . Yet the same analysis predicts the cost of produce electricity will rise . The saving to consumer , supposedly , will come from great efficiency and new conservation method that will lead to low energy usage overall , thereby lowering their out-of-pocket spending on electricity . That could happen , but the EPA projection rely on lot of variable and depend to a large degree on cheap and abundant natural gas , which could become more costly than expect if demand pick up and U.S. export rise . If this be go to result in a much greater pace of coal plant retirement than weve already see , then certainly there will be upward pressure on gas price , say Paul Flemming of research firm ESAI Power . And Obamas disprove claim about his health-reform plan if you like your healthcare plan , you can keep it be a fresh reminder that the promise of government official dont always pan out . The EPA law be meant to reduce the emission of harmful greenhouse gas associate with health problem such a respiratory and cardiovascular condition , along with rise global temperature . To do that , the rule will require power plant to cut carbon emission by 30 % , compare with 2005 level . The rule , which wont go into effect for at least a year and could change a interest group lobby for modification , would give state considerable leeway in term of how they meet the target a decentralize approach that have drawn praise from some energy analyst . A misleading claim ? But the idea that consumer wont feel any pain be probably mislead . For starter , the rule will put a heavy burden on state that rely most heavily on coal for electricity , include West Virginia , Kentucky , Indiana , Missouri , Wyoming and Utah . Coal produce the most carbon when burn , so state heavily dependent on coal will either have to build expensive new power plant rely on other fuel , or find other way to low emission . To balance the burden , the rule set low reduction target for coal-dependent state , but compliance will still be costly . Those cost will inevitably be pass on to consumer , whether through tax or fee , high electricity rate or some other mechanism . Other state have already wean themselves off coal or never depend on it much in the first place , include most New England and West Coast state , Nevada , Idaho , Mississippi , Alaska and Hawaii . States that have already do that work , or be bless with hydropower , be not go to experience a big increase in electricity price , say Adele Morris of the Brookings Institution . Although adjustment in those state will be relatively minor , some of them already have high electricity cost , on account of expensive upgrade already make . In the rest of the state , the direction of electricity rate will depend to a large extent on market force and consumer behavior . President Obama be a big fan of renewable energy source such a wind and solar power , but those technology be still expensive relative to their output , and arent economically viable in all place . ( Wind power doesnt work very well in hilly locales such a Vermont , or crowd place include Los Angeles , and solar power require more sunlight than some area get . ) In many state , the most cost-effective alternative to coal will be natural gas , which America now produce in abundance , thanks to new hydraulic fracturing drill technology . But a surge in demand for anything always push up price , unless supply rise by more . So the question be whether U.S. gas production now the large in the world , after Russia will keep pace with rise demand , especially a export of natural gas take off . The U.S. government must approve some gas export , but plan be already underway to build several costly export terminal , reflect a long-term commitment to shipping gas overseas . A surprise price shock Some analyst think there so much gas in the U.S. that price will stay flat for year . But a surprise energy supply shock occur this past winter when the cost of propane skyrocket , and gas price rise by more than expect as frigid temperature boost demand and supply fell short . Some business group would like to see a limit on gas export to assure supply remain abundant here at home , and price low . In it 376-page analysis of the new rule impact , the EPA explain how conservation effort could help low cost for consumer . The best way to cut down on carbon emission be to simply burn less carbon , which will give state new incentive to conserve . There could be tax rebate or other inducement for household to install more-efficient lighting and appliance or cut back in other way . If the money save through cutback exceeds price increase , consumer will be good off , on balance . Even if the new carbon limit do raise price for consumer , they might still represent prudent policy . Economists generally accept the idea that there be important social cost that cant be measure a easily a a line on a utility bill , such a lost productivity or quality of life degradation due to illness . So less carbon in the air could benefit million . Voters have a right to know the cost of progress , however , and theyve rightfully learn to doubt what government official tell them .
