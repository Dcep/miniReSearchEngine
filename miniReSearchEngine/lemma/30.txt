Estimates of the typical value for fuel economy and mile driven per week be from the Federal Highway Administration 's Highway Statistics 2007 Table VM-1 ( PDF ) ( 1 p , 11K ) . Note that EPA 's emission estimate be low than estimate obtain through fueleconomy.gov , because EPA 's estimate be for tailpipe emission only . The fueleconomy.gov site estimate emission over the full fuel lifecycle ( include extraction , processing , and transportation of fuel ) .

A Look at Residential Energy Consumption in 2005 Waste Disposal Estimates of greenhouse gas emission benefit from recycle newspaper , glass , plastic , metal , and magazine be develop use national waste data and life-cycle greenhouse gas emission factor for waste management . Calculations assume that it would be possible for household to recycle 100 percent of all recyclable material generate a waste . For example , if you indicate that you recycle newspaper , this calculator assume that you recycle 100 percent of the newspaper you receive . It be estimate that on average , each person generate 0.025 ton of newspaper , 0.038 ton of glass , 0.015 ton of plastic , 0.011 ton of metal , and 0.005 ton of magazine per year . EPA 's annual Characterization Report be the source of per caput waste generation by material type ( e.g. , newspaper waste generate per person ) . Source : U.S. Environmental Protection Agency , 2010 . Municipal Solid Waste Generation , Recycling , and Disposal in the United States : Facts and Figures for 2009 ( PDF ) ( 198 pp , 2.4MB , About PDF ) . Carbon dioxide equivalent emission associate with household waste management be calculate use the total emission for landfill ( include incineration , landfill gas-to-energy project , oxidation , and flare ) from EPA 's Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks , 1990-2009 and the United States population estimate from EPA 's annual Characterization Report mention above . The emission factor for each material type be develop by EPA and present in the Agency 's report on greenhouse gas emission from waste management and in the online WAste Reduction Model ( WARM ) . These emission factor take into account the full material life cycle ; i.e. , not only emission at the landfill , but also emission and sequestration associate with production , manufacturing , remanufacturing , forest carbon storage due to reduce harvest , etc . The emission factor use for recycling material in this calculator compare greenhouse gas emission from recycle with those attributable to landfilling . This approach enable policy maker to evaluate , on a per-ton basis , the overall difference in greenhouse gas emission between ( 1 ) recycle 1 ton of material and ( 2 ) manufacturing and then manage ( post-consumer ) 1 ton of the same material .
