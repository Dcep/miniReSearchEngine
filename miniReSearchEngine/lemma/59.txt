The utility have already agree to shut the plant in 2020 , but Oregon be still a significant importer of power generate at coal-fired plant in Wyoming and Montana . ( ( The Oregonian/Brent Wojahn ) ) Print Ted Sickinger| The Oregonian/OregonLive By Ted Sickinger| The Oregonian/OregonLive The Oregonian Email the author | Follow on Twitter on February 02 , 2015 at 6:00 AM , update February 04 , 2015 at 4:33 PM View/Post Comments Two Oregon lawmaker have introduce a bill that would upend Oregon 's energy supply , eliminate electricity from coal-fired power plant in the next decade and replace it with primarily wind and solar energy . The `` Coal to Clean '' legislation would not only ban coal , but mandate that utility replace it with energy source that be 90 percent cleaner . That would bar utility from build big natural gas-fired plant , take two of their large and most reliable source of power off the table . That would create a big and potentially expensive hole to backfill . Even with the region 's abundance of hydroelectric power , fully a third of the electricity consume by Oregonians come from coal-fired power plant spread around the west . PacifiCorp still rely on coal to supply two-thirds of it customer ' power across six state , and Portland General Electric for about 30 percent of the energy it deliver in Oregon . Both utility have be under pressure from environmental and ratepayer group to transition away from coal , but the go-to resource to replace it have be natural gas , which have it own environmental issue ( though only about half the carbon intensity of coal ) . Environmental group say it 's too risky to keep investing in dirty fossil fuel , whether upgrading coal plant with new pollution control or build new gas plant . Neither eliminates carbon dioxide emission , and both could leave ratepayer at risk of strand investment or carbon penalty if strict greenhouse regulation be adopt . `` We think it will be cheap for customer to transition away from dirty resource now and invest in a cleaner mix , `` say Rachel Shimshak , executive director of the advocacy group Renewable Northwest . `` You might as well make the right decision in the first place . It 's a no-regrets policy . '' Utilities , however , think their ratepayer may have some regret when they see the price tag and the policy 's impact on reliability . `` Its going to be in the billion and billion of dollar and how that break out for Oregon , it 's inestimable , '' say PacifiCorp spokesman Paul Vogel . `` It 's not the right way to go about this transition that we all agree that we need to be on . '' The sponsor of the bill be Sen. Chris Edwards , D-Eugene , and Rep Tobias Read , D-Beaverton . But the source of the legislation be the Sierra Club , the Oregon Conservation Network and and Renewable Northwest , which have be push a `` Beyond Coal '' campaign in Oregon for some time . Oregon 's residential ratepayer advocate , the Citizen 's Utility Board of Oregon , be also endorse the bill despite the fact that no cost estimate have be produce . `` Ultimately we 're go to have to reduce our emission and close the coal plant , '' say Bob Jenks , CUB 's executive director . `` The theory here be let 's phase these out in a reasonable timetable of ten year and do this in a way that 's least cost to ratepayer . '' The cost be a big , unanswered question , a be whether the legislation would have any practical effect in reducing greenhouse gas emission . Oregon ca n't legislate the closure of out-of-state coal plant , which could simply dispatch their output elsewhere . And in reality , it 's not possible to reject coal-based electron at the state border or always discriminate between resource when make purchase in the wholesale power market . The Sierra Club release the result of a poll Thursday suggesting that 71 percent of Oregonians support the bill . More than half of respondent - 58 percent - say they support the proposal even if it would increase their energy bill . And in a bit of political stagecraft , the poll also find 47 percent of respondent say they would be more likely to vote for a politician who support it . Ratepayers do consistently tell utility in survey that they support renewables and would like to move away from coal . But it 's not at all clear how much they 're willing to pay for it . Ratepayers already have the option of pay about 10 percent more on their utility bill to offset the carbon impact of their electricity use by purchase renewable energy credit . Only about 10 percent of customer opt to do it . PGE have already agree to shut it 585-megawatt Boardman coal plant in eastern Oregon in 2020 , though it have n't firm up plan for replace it . Besides Boardman , there be two primary source of coal-fired power serve Oregon : PacifiCorp 's 2,100-megawatt Jim Bridger plant in Wyoming , and the Colstrip plant in Montana , in which PGE and PacifiCorp have a collective stake of about 450 megawatt . Tobias Read , the sponsor of the house version of the bill , say even if those out-of- state plant do n't close , Oregon would enjoy substantial economic development when the utility go to replace the power with a combination of home-grown renewables , energy efficiency and other demand reduction program . Yet replace even 1,000 megawatt of coal with the cheap renewable available - wind energy - could prove impractical . It would require utility to build some 3,000 megawatt of capacity , a wind turbine typically produce only about a third of their capacity . That 's an enormous addition to the current wind fleet , and most of the best wind site in Oregon be already take . The intermittent nature of the resource could also create reliability issue , transmission logjam , and exacerbate oversupply issue in the spring and summer , when wind and hydroelectric dam already produce more electricity than the region can absorb . The Bonneville Power Administration say it have already tap out it ability to integrate more wind energy in the region , which be typically accomplish by cycling the output of the federal dam up and down . And to get a sense of the potential cost , consider PGE 's recent purchase of the Tucannon River wind farm in Southeast Washington . With just 267 megawatt of nameplate capacity , it cost $ 500 million . PGE spokesman Steve Corson note that utility be already deal with new federal mandate govern greenhouse gas emission at exist power plant and be tackle the coal retirement issue as part of the `` integrate resource plan '' they file every other year . `` All these issue be go to have to be address in those analytical process , and from our perspective that 's where they belong , not in some arbitrary stop-the-electrons-here bill . We 're very concern about something that make such sweeping change in our resource plan process in such a short time frame . '' Shimshak of Renewables Northwest say utility be hide behind the cost and reliability question , when their customer be tell them this be a concept they support . Both Read and Chris Edwards , who chair the Senate Committee on Environment and Natural Resources , say they 're not wed to any of the specific number in the bill and be still try to understand the implication , cost and otherwise . `` The bill in it current state need a lot of work , '' Edwards say . `` There 's no doubt that there 's broad philosophical support for move in this direction . But people also want to understand the detail , and we ca n't move blindly forward without understanding the impact on rates. `` `` We 're try to move this conversation into a high gear , and we 're also try to develop smart solution to clean up the region 's energy mix .
