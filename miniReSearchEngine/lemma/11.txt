I think I would measure my toaster , a well it 's breakfast time ... almost . Toast be eat alot for breakfast around the world , it quick and convenient . But how much energy be consume in making your bread golden brown ? I test the Russell Hobb Satin Classic 2 Slice Toaster ( Model No . 14360 ) , it match my kettle , that I measure early . I measure on a medium set , which toast the bread for 177 second . The toaster use between 1155W and 1232W . Toasting two slice of bread use 0.06kWh ( about 0.8 penny ) . However most toaster have only an option for two slice , you can toast one slice but , it still require the same amount of energy a each slot do not operate independently , I know that be a bit extreme to point out such a small issue , and I 'm sure that the percentage of people toast one slice be in percentage term a small minority , but the energy save could be huge if take across the globe .
