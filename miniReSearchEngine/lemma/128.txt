How to save electricity on lighting Last Update : July 2013 Lighting be be the third-biggest energy user in most home . But it 's probably the easy area to save in . You can start save a whopping 70-90 % right away by simply screw in new LED or CFL light . And if you're concern about mercury from CFL bulb break , you can either use a CFL that have a plastic cover , or use an LED bulb instead . Environmental Defense have the best explanation of what 's wrong with regular light bulb : `` Though we call them light bulb , traditional incandescent bulb be actually small heater that give off a little bit of light something you know if you 've ever touch a bulb that 's be on for a while . These bulb be technological wonder when they be patent in 1880 , but today they be inefficient dinosaur . They waste energy and money , and they be responsible for million of ton of global warming pollution .

A single 100-watt bulb leave on continuously will run you $ 12 a month ( assume 16/kWh ) . That 's the short summary on saving energy on your lighting . Below be the detail , a well a several other money-saving tip . Use CFL or LED light . You have two choice to replace your old-school , energy-guzzling light : LED or CFL . They're both good choice , produce very good light , be direct screw-in replacement for your current bulb , and save ton of energy . So there 's no need to ob over which one to choose . LED be generally well but the current cost be still high ? $ 13 for an LED bulb vs. $ 2 for a CFL . You 'll make up the extra cost for the LED from the energy it save , but if you ca n't stomach the up-front cost , just go with CFL . Either way , the calculator at right show you how much you can save . If you 've hear the scare-mongering about mercury in CFLs , relax . The median exposure for a broken CFL be 0.07 mcg , while six ounce of Albacore tuna have 48 mcg ? 700 time as much . ( See this paper by LBL scientist for more . ) And of course , you can always use a CFL that have a plastic cover , or use an LED light . Here 's a table showing the difference between the different kind of light bulb : Incandescent vs. CFL vs . LED Incandescent CFL LED Cost Cost over 25,000 hour ( bulb + electricity ) $ 317 $ 78 $ 65 Cost for one 60-watt equivalent bulb $ 1 $ 3 $ 18 Cost over 25,000 hour ( bulb only ) $ 17 $ 15 $ 18 Cost over 25,000 hour ( electricity only ) $ 300 $ 63 $ 47 Life Life ( in hour ) 1500 5000 25,000 Life reduce by cycling on/off A wee bit A little bit Not at all Light output over it life Constant ~70 % of initial brightness by end of life ( 30 % drop ) Applications Dimmable All model Some model Can be use in enclose fixture All model Som model Never Good in freeze temperature All model Rare model All model Characteristics Light quality Excellent Excellent Excellent Time need to get fully bright Instant ~1 minute ( some model be instant ) Instant Heat generate ( source , source 2 ) A lot A little A little Toxic mercury No Barely No How breakable Fragile Fragile Strong Watts for 1600 lumen 100 25 16 When shop for light , you 'll probably want to choose warm white , which have the pleasing yellowish tint . By contrast , cold white be the harsh bluish light . The color temperature ( often print on the package ) tell you exactly how warm or cold the light be . Warm be 2700-3000k , and cold be 3600-5500k . Lumens-to-Watts Converter Lumens Incandescent Watts CFL Watts LED Watts 250 25 7 4 450 40 11 6 800 60 15 10 1100 75 21 12 1600 100 27 16 Yes , manufacturer fudge their number , and compare apples-to-apples be difficult anyway because different bulb send light in different direction . But for practical purpose , this table be usually accurate enough . And despite some claim that LEDs require just a many watt a CFLs to output the same amount of light , my own test show an 8w LED to be comparable to a 13w CFL . Many online retailer do n't bother to tell you how bright their LED light be in watt-equivalents . A rule of thumb be to just multiply the LED wattage by 6 . So if you 're look at a 10-watt LED , it 's a 60-watt equivalent . I also recommend check the lumen , which be a measure of brightness . The table at right show how many lumen you should be look for depend on what kind of light you 're buy . When buy CFLs , make sure they either have the Energy Star logo or come with a warranty . The cheap CFLs can burn out really fast . I have a separate page which cover CFL 's in more detail , include the real story behind the mercury warning . Halogen light be similar to traditional incandescents , except they use 20-30 % less energy . They 're definitely inferior to CFLs and LEDs which use 73-84 % less energy , but if for some reason you ca n't stand CFLs or LEDs , then halogens be an option . Turn off light when you 're not use them , even for just a few minute . The idea that light use extra electricity to start up be a myth . You 'll save electricity every time you turn the light off , no matter how short the off duration , and whether they 're regular light or fluorescent . You might have hear that you wear out your light quicker by cycling them off and on , but that effect be so small it's not worth worrying about , and you can safely turn your light off every time you leave the room , no matter how short the duration . If you feel you need to ob over this ( a evidence from all the email I get about the subject ) then see my answer about fluorescent cycle cost . Use a motion sensor for outside lighting Exterior security light automatically shut off after 1-15 minute , so you 're not pay to run them all night . Fixtures start at $ 20 at home improvement store like Home Depot . Do not that you ca n't use CFL 's in security light though , because the fixture cycle a very small amount of voltage through the light constantly which make the CFL's die a lot faster . Exercise : You buy a security light for $ 20 . The light use to be on all night , for 12 hour each night . Now it 's on for about an hour a night . You 're use two 75-watt bulb in the fixture . How long do it take for the security light to pay for itself ? ( assume electricity cost 15/kWh ) ( see answer ) Old way : 2 bulb x 75W x 12 hrs/day x 30.5 days/mo . 1000 w/kW x $ 0.15/kWh = $ 8.24/mo . New way : 2 bulb x 75W x 1 hr/day x 30.5 days/mo . 1000 w/kWh x $ 0.15/kWh = $ 0.69/mo . Savings per month : $ 8.24 - $ 0.69 = $ 7.55 Payback time : $ 20 / $ 7.55 = 2.6 month What the hell be you wait for ? Put nightlights on photosensors . You can get a simple screw-in photosensor for $ 4.50 ( $ 8.50 for the outdoor version ) which will automatically turn your light on at night and off during the day . You just screw the special socket into the exist light socket , then screw the light bulb into the special socket . Exercise : How long do it take for one of these $ 4.50 device ( indoor version ) to pay for itself , assume you be use a 60-watt bulb , pay 15/kWh for electricity , and save 12 hour per day of light use ? ( see answer ) Old way : 60W x 24 hrs/day x 30.5 days/mo . 1000 w/kW x $ 0.15/kWh = $ 6.59/mo . New way : 60W x 12 hrs/day x 30.5 days/mo . 1000 w/kWh x $ 0.15/kWh = $ 3.29/mo . Monthly saving : $ 6.59 - 3.29 = $ 3.30/mo . Payback time : $ 4.50 3.30 = 1.4 month You can also make lamp or other device go off during the day and turn on at night by use a plug-in light sensor ( $ 6 ) . You plug the appliance into the sensor , and then plug the sensor into the wall . If you 're handy with electrical wiring , you can mount a light sensor to a wall ( like you 'd mount a light switch or electrical outlet ) . Wire-in sensor be around $ 10 . Use a motion sensor for interior lighting . If you ca n't remember ( or ca n't be bother ) to turn off the light throughout your house , a motion-sensor switch will shut them off for you automatically . You can buy motion-sensing wall switch for as little a $ 10 at a home improvement store . Use the lowest-wattage bulb for light that be always on ( e.g. , stairways ) . Replacing 75-watt bulb with 15-watt bulb reduces energy usage by 80 % . Replacing them with LED or CFL light save even more . Exercise : How much do you save in a year by replacing a 75-watt bulb with a 5-watt bulb , for a light that 's on 24/7 ? Use 15/kWh for the cost . ( see answer ) Old way : 75W x 24 hrs/day x 30.5 days/mo . 1000 w/kW x $ 0.15/kWh = $ 8.24/mo . New way : 5W x 24 hrs/day x 30.5 days/mo . 1000 w/kWh x $ 0.15/kWh = $ 0.55/mo . Savings per month : $ 8.24 - $ 0.55 = $ 7.69 ( 93 % ! ) Replace fluorescent magnetic ballast with electronic one . For long-tube fluorescent light ( a oppose to screw-in compact fluorescent ) , an old-style magnetic ballast might use 100W to power two 40W tube , while an electronic ballast might use only 60W . Also , the electronic ballast eliminates flicker and usually eliminate hum . They also generate less heat , which save additional money on cool . Install a skylight . Using natural lighting save a bunch of energy and produce a much nicer environment besides . Modern skylight be available which let in only the light and not the heat . Use LED holiday light . LED Christmas light use 84 % less electricity than standard holiday light ( which use 25 watt in a typical 50-bulb strand ) . LED light also generate much less heat , so they 're less likely to catch your Christmas tree on fire . Another advantage be that the LED 's be virtually indestructible ? they do n't burn out like normal bulb ( not for about ten year , anyway ) , and they 're not fragile like normal holiday light . I actually unsuccessfully try to crush one by standing on it on a concrete surface . I break the decorative casing but be unable to break the LED bulb itself ? it still light up just fine when I plug it back in . I put a few strand of LED Xmas light on the ceiling and use it a mood light . ( Yeah , I know the packaging say not to use them for permanent installation , but that 's just how I roll . ) Inirgee sell a nice variety of LED light in a variety of color : 120V holiday light string , and 12V holiday light string to be power from a battery . Notably , most of the product carry a lifetime warranty . I have a separate page about rewire Christmas light to run off battery . Use solar or LED landscape light Replacing your old landscape lighting with solar or LED can save a fair amount of money . Do n't be fool into thinking your exist light be low-energy just because they 're `` low-voltage '' . A low-voltage system us the same amount of energy a a high-voltage system , since it's the watt-hour you get charge for , not the volt . Solar light be great , but absolutely buy a model with a warranty . Many of the cheap solar landscape light on the market now last only a year or two before the solar panel wear out and the light be useless . Yes , I know the price be really attractive , but do n't skip the warranty !
