While many runner or cyclist often estimate calorie burn ( and thus cookie allocation metric ) use borderline sketchy back of the napkin calculation , there also a significant portion of the population that look to use their Garmin device to determine calorie burn . The challenge that many folk have find out be that different Garmin device produce different result , and sometimes even different result for the same person . Further , a specific device can even product different result for the same person dependent on how it configure . So , I set out to put together a bit of the definitive guide to calorie calculation on Garmin fitness device . Back when I be at the ANT+ Symposium in Calgary I sit down to start the conversation with the Garmin team there . Then more recently last week I meet up again with the Garmin fitness team to talk through all the painstaking detail . The Main Methods As you might have guess , there be actually a number of way in which your Garmin device will calculate how many calorie youve burn . And not unexpectedly , the accuracy level varies base on which method you use . Some method offer a rudimentary guesstimate , while others be base on scientific testing thats then import into your device to get far more accurate result . So , let walk through each of the six major method , start with the most accurate , and work our way down the list to the less accurate ( the last option , Kilojoules , isnt really less accurate per se , but differentmore in a moment ) . 1 ) New Leaf VO2 Test Profile : This method require testing at one of a number of New Leaf testing center around the country . New Leaf be actually a 3rd party company thats develop a pretty comprehensive way to determine calorie burn base on VO2 test that be do . The test be not terribly unlike your common VO2 max test , and involve you be hook up to tube and wire . The test though be sport-specific , mean you complete a running test to allow the Forerunner to determine run activity calorie . The test dont cross over , but there be test available for running , cycle and elliptical . Once a test be complete you can download your profile into your Garmin device to get the most accurate calorie burn metric when combine with a heart rate monitor . Im look to get a New Leaf test done and put together a post or series of post on the experience and accuracy I see . Heres the list of current device , and level of compatibility . 2 ) Firstbeat Algorithm ( Current 2nd Generation ) : The Firstbeat algorithm be the most accurate Garmin device calorie measurement that can be do without external testing . But it actually not develop natively by Garmin . Its develop by a Finish company ( Firstbeat Technologies ) that have it root in calculation around Olympic athlete , specifically Nordic skiing . Their calculation use user inputted variable include gender , height , weight and fitness class . It then combine this data with heart rate information from the ANT+ heart rate strap . Specifically , it evaluate the time between heart beat ( beat to beat ) to determine estimate MET ( Metabolic Equivalent ) , which in turn be use determine actual work expenditure . This make the system one of the more accurate non-invasive option ( read : doesnt require a laboratory ) , within about 10 % accuracy . Firstbeat have publish a fascinate white paper detail the technology and accuracy rate . This little snippet below though help to show where the technology lie accuracy-wise with it be right in the upper-middle compare to full-board lab operation on one end , and distance/time calculation on the other end ( click below to expand picture ) . Finally , this metric also learn you a an athlete on a give device . Meaning , over time it have a weight algorithm to note change in your fitness level and adjust calorie burn accordingly . I ask how friend and family use a device might impact this . They note that a single one-time use wasnt weight heavily enough to make a difference , but that obviously a couple share a single device would see less accurate result ( both due to the profile information be incorrect 50 % of the time , a well a the learning aspect be off ) . It also should be note that the second-generation of the Firstbeat algorithm be only applicable to run currently , and isnt use in the cycling product yet . 3 ) Firstbeat Algorithm ( 1st Generation ) : This be essentially the same a the above note algorithmexcept just slightly less accurate . This first generation algorithm be use on device prior to this year , which be detail in the below table . Like any product , technology or concept the calculation have evolve and be make available in it most recent incarnation on Garmins most recent device . One interesting tidbit be that they find that while this 1st generation algorithm work really well for new runner , it be less accurate in more advanced runner hence some of the update see in the 2nd generation . 4 ) FR60 Heart Rate Algorithm : The FR60 non-GPS run watch have a proprietary heart rate base algorithm thats use when a heart rate strap be enable . The primary driver of this be to remove the dependency on speed/distance thats typically associate with a GPS unit ( since the FR60 be not GPS-based ) . The Garmin engineer describe this algorithm a a classic heart rate base calorie burn calculation , with virtually no extra fancy toss in to make it significantly more accurate . There be no plan to evolve this one-off algorithm to other device ( include the next version of the FR60 ) , nor to port either Firstbeat to the FR60 . 5 ) Speed/Distance Algorithm : This be the most basic method of determine calorie , a it be only use when a heart rate strap be not enabled/used ( default ) . Given the lack of heart rate data , the unit will simply use speed/distance , a well a the weight you enter in the device setup . The reason this be less accurate ( 65-80 % accurate ) be that it cant differentiate how much effort youre expend to travel a give distance which while less important for run , be quite important for cycling . For example , if youre coast down a 7 mile descent , youll burn virtually no calorie compare to ascending the same mountain . This speed/distance algorithm do not consider or evaluate the impact of elevation change primarily due to concern the team have about rely on GPS-based elevation to determine calorie . They also reason that while the Edge units have barometric altimeter , it be well to focus on heart-rate base calorie burn , a oppose to simply expand the guesstimate that the speed/distance algorithm be . Finally , note that if you wear a heart-rate monitor/strap speed/distance be ignore , and instead one of the other above ( more accurate ) method be use . 5 ) Power Meter to get Kilojoules : While not technically calories , the kilojoules be a unit of work , and thus be a method that some folk may use to judge how much effort be expend on a give workout . This method be only available on unit that support power meter ( Forerunner 310XT , Edge 500/705/800 ) , and require a compatible 3rd party ANT+ power meter ( such a a Power Tap hub , Quarq Cinqo , SRM , etc ) . This isnt less accurate , but rather a different metric than straight calorie . You can convert from kilojoules to calorie . Finally , it should be point out that the overall philosophy of the team is/was to get folk use heart rate strap if they want accurate calorie metric . Device Breakdown Running/Multisport So now that weve gone through and cover the main method for calorie calculation , let break it down on a per-device basis . Well start off with the run and multisport relate device . You can click to expand the chart and get a full view that make it a bit more visible . As you can see , the most recent device ( FR210/FR410 ) have the most up to date calorie metric primarily be the 2nd generation Firstbeat Algorithm . However , many device support the New Leaf test , almost everything except the FR205 , which be simply because it doesnt support a heart rate strap . Device Breakdown Cycling Next up be the cycling side of thing . Youll see that again like the running device , the new device such a the Edge 500 and Edge 800 , have the most recent calorie calculation available . As youll notice , the Edge device also add the kilojoules power meter option , for those with compatible ANT+ power meter . Device Master Sheet And finally , one master sheet of all device in a single table : Heart Rate Straps Given so much of the the calorie calculation be dependent on a heart rate strap , I should point out that any ANT+ heart rate strap will work when it come to gather heart rate data that the Garmin device can use . However , there be a few different Garmin-made ANT+ strap out there to select from . The three that be available today be : 1 ) Classic Garmin Heart Rate Strap : This be the most common version , and also be around the long . It feature a plastic portion of the strap that read your heart rate , while the remainder of the strap be fabric . 2 ) Pre-2010 Premium Heart Rate Strap : This strap version come out in Spring 2009 , along with the Forerunner 310XT . It feature a fully fabric band all the way around , with snap-on connector hold the transmitter portion to the fabric . 3 ) 2010 New Premium Heart Rate Strap : This version come out in August 2010 alongside the Edge 800 , and be now ship with all premium heart rate strap unit ( i.e . FR310XT , Edge 800 , etc ) . This one aim to resolve some of the spiking/dropout issue note in the pre-2010 version . In my testing over the past few month , this seem to resolve about 95 % of the spiking issue that Ive see . This version will be available for individual purchase , but an exact timeline hasnt be fully finalize . Note that I ask if there be a good name for the new strap besides New-new Premium Heart Rate Strap , and the team hadnt really come up with a good name to use externally . So , for now , Im go with 2010 New Premium Heart Rate Strap . In general , remember , if youre have problem with heart rate strap reading , be sure to check out both of my post on the subject first part here and part two here . Summary Theres no doubt that the Garmin fitness device offer a plethora of calorie calculation option . Before I start look into this I would have say that there be too many option , however , after understanding the different option well and the differing level of accuracy each one offer , I have a good grasp on why there be so many different way to calculate calorie . As you can see , in many way it end up be a matter of how much effort ( or perhaps time/money ) one want to invest in the solution to get the most accurate result .

Reply tm November 24 , 2010 at 3:18 pm # 4 Great article - just pick up an Edge 800 and from what I 've see the kcal estimate be a massive improvement over the 705 . The almost laughable reading the old Garmins produce be the main thing keep me use my Polar for run , but from the look of it they 've make some big step forward on that front ! You mention that the Firstbeat algorithm use beat-to-beat measurement , so I be wonder if Garmin 's HR strap actually delivers this data ( and discard it ) or if it 's just reconstruct it from the second-by-second reading ? I always figure that the reason Garmin do n't provide R-R data like Polar/Suunto be that the ANT+ profile do n't support it - but if that data be be deliver to the head unit it 's a bit of a shame if they 're just throw it away . Also , do you have any thought about the accuracy of these algorithm compare to that of their competitor ? Polar and Suunto have be use their own R-R heart-rate base caloric calculation for a while - so I 'd be interested to hear how these compare ?

Reply Alistair November 25 , 2010 at 2:21 pm # 7 @ TMS : Suunto have be use firstbeat with the R-R data on their high end watch for a while . One thing I really miss from my T6 in my rowing day be the wealth of info I could pull out from workout relate to oxygen debt , calorie usage etc . The TE score be pretty useful once you get thing well enough calibrate too . Certainly good enough to help guide thing when I be do less structure training in the off season . On the other hand with the 310xt I get decent gps and the facility for power go forward , so that be the trade off for triathlon type training . The 310 certainly do n't store all the R-R info which be a shame a it have the space . I would have think the ant+ protocol can cope as the suunto watch use plain ant to receive their data . Kind of interested a to whether the 310xt actually do handle r-r data internally a then in theory it should be possible to save it and use it for detailed analysis base on variability in interval ...

This be a normal ride , 1100 ft of elevation gain and relatively fast . 350 calorie ! NOT ! I estimate ( via the old 705 ) that I burn just under 1000 calorie per hour on my usual ride .

Reply Rodrigo May 24 , 2011 at 4:36 pm # 22 From the chart , look like the EDGE705 calculate calorie use only speed/distance , regardless if you have an HR strap or not ... That explain the bad reading I get when I 'm use it . I also have a powertap , so I usually get the calorie count from the powertap software instead of the garmin software . Would that be the best way to do it , or do you have a different recommendation ?

Reply Kel June 29 , 2011 at 9:21 pm # 23 I also be wonder about the FR305 . I have n't have a test done so I 'm guess it just use the speed/distance thing ... So what 's the point of the heart rate strap then ? I have an old , plain jane HR monitor and it calculate calorie base on the heart rate over time . However when I use my 305 indoors with the GPS off , I can see it 's count my HR but I just get a 0 for calorie . However if I then plug in the data from the bike for distance , SportTracks come up with a calorie number . Of course it 's way off from what the actual bike tell me but at least it 's something . Maybe I 'm just miss something ? Reply link do not work in your browser because JavaScript be disable . Reply CW in Dallas August 31 , 2011 at 2:08 am # 24 Apparently the new premium HR strap can make a huge difference . I first bought a new 410 and use it on 9 mile run with my old style monitor strap . It say I burn 805 calorie . Did n't like the touch bezel on the 410 ; the 210 went on sale ; so I exchange at REI . Same 9 mile run ( actually run at a fast pace , but nearly same record heart rate ) with 210 and new premium strap that come with it , yield only 498 calorie . I assume the 410 and 210 use same calorie count technology . Again , the new model strap I use with the 210 show an average HR of 126 while the old style strap couple with the 410 have my average HR at 127 ( despite my running 30 second per mile faster the day I use the 210 ) . I should also state that my user profile setting be the same with my height , weight , age , and `` lifetime athlete . '' So , same user profile , same route and distance , similar weather condition , nearly the same measure average HR ; yet huge calorie count discrepancy between 410 with old style strap vs. 410 with new premium strap . Does this make any sense at all ? I must say less than 500 calorie for a 9 mile run at a pretty good pace ( for me ) be damn disappointing .

Reply Rainmaker October 7 , 2011 at 2:10 pm # 28 Hi All- RE : FR305 Indeed , the FR305 really do NOT do HR base calorie metric unless you have a New Leaf test done . I 've confirm this again with Garmin , and this can be confirm in multiple place on the Garmin Forums : link to forums.garmin.com With a New Leaf test you can then use the HR starp to get accurate calorie burn on the FR305 , but otherwise it 's just speed/dist/weight calcs . RE : New Strap vs Old Strap There 's no difference between the two strap from a calorie basis - unless the strap be give incorrect reading altogether . ANT+ strap do n't do calorie calculation , nor can a Garmin unit tell the difference between a soft strap and a classic strap ( or even two generation of soft strap ) . The ANT+ Device Profile do n't contain the ability to transfer calorie ( or store weight information ) . That say , look at the two device , there could be something else at play here - include perhaps just a bug . Reply link do not work in your browser because JavaScript be disable .

Reply Carol Calhoun June 15 , 2012 at 2:57 am # 45 I be get calorie reading on my new Edge 500 that be so wildly different from those on my old Edge 705 that they make me wonder whether the calorie reading be of any use at all . As an example , today I complete a 12.13 mile bike ride in 1:23:08 , and my Edge 500 say I use 465 calorie . A week ago , I do substantially the same ride , in substantially the same amount of time , without either my weight or the bicycle 's differing much , and my Edge 705 say I use 1544 calorie . Obviously , a calorie reading of somewhere between 465 calorie and 1544 calorie be of absolutely no use to me . And this be characteristic of the difference in result I 'm get with other ride . Initially , I think perhaps I have my HRM adjust badly so that it be pick up only some of my heartbeat . ( This hypothesis be suggest by the fact that on my very first ride , the Garmin claim my average heart rate be 67 , which seem improbable . ) However , I now have the Garmin adjust so that it constantly show me current heart rate , and the rate show seem reasonable . There be reference to the monitor `` learning '' a I go along . Will this occur even if the majority of my cardio exercise be not record with the Garmin ? I typically bike about three day a week , which I record with the Garmin . However , the remain day , I use cardio equipment ( stationary bicycle or elliptical ) at the gym , and do not use the Garmin for that . I 'm just wonder whether the learning require that the Garmin know the frequency with which I exercise , or whether it could do the learning just by monitoring my exercise several time a week . And be there anything else I could do to reconcile the two device ? I have a cadence meter , which I have never use ; I 'm not sure whether use it would help . I have set my fitness class at 9 , which reflects my current level of activity . Any other idea ? Reply link do not work in your browser because JavaScript be disable .

Reply Unknown October 6 , 2012 at 5:14 pm # 51 Peter , Good question a I have just read this page and be think the same thing . However , no , I do n't think Ray be say that the FirstBeat algorithms be specific to a sport in term of calorie , because of this : `` Their calculation us user inputted variable include gender , height , weight and fitness class . It then combine this data with heart rate information from the ANT+ heart rate strap . Specifically , it evaluate the time between heart beat ( beat to beat ) to determine estimate MET ( Metabolic Equivalent ) , which in turn be use determine actual work expenditure . '' If you look on the more detailed link from when when Ray quiz Garmin , you will see that there be more detail but not much to add - i.e . when calculate calorie in this very accurate way , the relative fitness of the person ( stroke volume , maximum heart rate , recovery , fitness , height , weight , and whatever else they use from user inputted date , etc ) , can only be guess and refine , but the heart rate that go with it be the only other variable - not the exercise that produce the heart rate . All other research I 've do on the internet just now , seem to suggest that this be the case . e.g . If you weight train or sprint and reach 160 bpm reduce to 130 and back up again etc for an hour , that 's the same calorie a run or cycle with the same HRs - although of course that would be very hard to sustain for the hour with muscular weight training , if not impossible . However the reason for my post be that I hope that Ray can just confirm and answer your point , just to be 100 % sure . Ray , thank for excellent article and detail .

There be only a 1 bpm difference in one of the interval . So quite satisfy with that and be expect a much . Calorie count however be way off even though rider data enter ( age , weight , height ) be the same . With an average 145 bpm over the entire work out I burn 360 cal on the Garmin and 475 on the Polar . Quite a difference and I remain dissatisfied a to which one be best .

The fact be , only the power meter be directly measure work done . All those other method be fake it via estimation algorithm . Algorithms that be skew horrendously by everything from weather to fatigue status . They 're a reliable a a Garmin Vector release schedule . Whereas measurement for mechanical efficiency be extremely well know and consistent - in essence , gross mechanical efficiency be almost always 20.5 % 1.5 % . I go look for paper that support that figure . Heck , I quickly find so many I go look for a counterexample instead . There be one : the top handful of gift and hardworking cyclist improve on that gross efficiency range , get up to 24 % ( we do n't count Lance 's 25 % ) [ 1 ] ; for all intent and purpose , they be outlier and not a useful data point ; moreover , this efficiency level be not retain [ 2 ] . So , if a club cyclist rid at 175W for an hour , they should consider themselves to have burn 735 kcal , 1.5 % . For the world 's top-10 professional , a little over 600kcal . And , ahem , far from be `` not much of anything '' , that 's at least 25 % of your myological glycogen storage and failure to account for it could be the difference between hit the wall or not . Similarly , I do n't see why bring an untrained athlete into the discussion add anything useful . `` Let 's go find someone who do n't know what they 're do and therefore waste lot of energy '' .

The crosstrainer or treadmill show 300-400 calorie ( depend on the time and intensity ) , but the Forerunner 210 show about 130-140 calorie . What can I do to improve the accuracy ? It be not possible to choose an activity level on the device , other than yes or no to athlete . I 've read that activitylevel and VO2 Max be important variable in the Firstbeat algorithm . But those variable Are not possible to register in the device . The inaccuracy be a major problem to me , and I 'm very dissatisfy about it . Considering to buy another watch .

However , I think the other device be actually like overestimate calorie . The general 'golden rule ' of walking/running be 100 calorie per mile . Thus , at roughly at about 2.7 mile it burn 264 calorie be quite reasonable . Endomondo say 600 calorie be simply crazy . There be case where calorie burn be high ( for example , if you weigh significantly more - for those that be significantly overweight ) , or , in case where you 're at/near VO2Max intensity .

I do n't know enough about the scientific side to know whether ( for example a 60kg person burn half a much a a 120kg person ) . In general , I 'd believe data from Garmin , Polar , etc ... over data from Endomondo - only because I know where that data come from ( FirstBeat and a few other Finland firm focus 100 % on HR calorie burn ) .

Reply Cary May 12 , 2014 at 1:11 pm # 113 Ray- I have the 220 . I recently have a V02 Max test which calculate my calorie burn ( and fat and carb metabolism ) along my heart rate profile . Using those number to calculate my caloric burn ( base upon average heart rate for an entire run ) I come up with caloric number that be way different than what my 220 be calculate . Example : I just run a hilly ( 6800ft of gain ) 50k trail race on Saturday in 4:30:30 . Average HR be 137 . Based upon lab data I burn 951 calorie per hour at a hear rate of 137 . Thus , I get 4,275 calorie for the total . My 220 say 3,015 . I should note that I have a somewhat low Max heart rate of 165 for a 45 year old train athlete . I weigh 155 and am 5'10 '' . I put whatever data I could into my Garmin profile . Any idea on how to get the 220 more accurate ? Or could the V02 Max data be overestimate caloric burn ?

Reply pkiszk August 21 , 2014 at 6:26 pm # 115 I come across this article while ponder about SportTracks ( 3.xx ) calorie calc method . I use ST to record my running , row ( concept2 rower ) and cycle ( no power meter though ) . I use HR strap all the time . Concept2 rower give me detail power data a well . Now , ST allow you to determine calorie spend on the basis of HR ( setting under category ) . Does this method use Firstbeat ( 1 / 2 ? ) - under their `` Heart rate method '' set ? This would be great and solve any issue for me at least ( a heavy ST user ) . If not - what method ? I must also say , that Old Man 's Biking plugin ( GPS2PowerTrack ) add Power base calorie calculation which give you a bit different calcs amount ( a few % low ) but by not a big amount ( for my workout on a rower ) . Which , assume that what Josh say about that particular method be accurate , suggest ST 's method relying on HR be also quite good . Having say all of that , I still doubt if a 30min moderate run ( 5km , so pace of 10km/h , avg 70 % max HR in my case ) yield in 330 in calorie burn ( or 660 per hour ) - I remember a rule of thumb for run - that it burn 300-400 calorie per hour ( or , to say figuratively , one need to run for an hour to burn a donut cake ) . So how come the method base on HR report 50 % more than that ( or more than 50 % if one assumes 300cals a basis ) ? On the other hand , it match the golden rule of 100calories / mile ( 5km be 3.125 mile ) . All I want to say - be that I remain skeptical about calorie burn as report by ST / Firstbeat method vs calorie intake that we consume in food . I think one need to adjust downwards the amount report by ST or Garmin in order to keep the intake/output calorie balance in our daily life . I would welcome your view . [ But I would love to be wrong and find out that a moderate off road cycle at an avg of 65 % max HR for 2,5 hour burn 1500cals , a report by ST in my case - but I simply ca n't believe it ! ] Reply link do not work in your browser because JavaScript be disable .

I 'm almost 24 year old , weigh 75 kilogram , and have a rest HR that be around 56-58 last time I check . I have n't do an actual Max HR test , but be use formula that put it in the ~185 range . My VO2Max from my Garmin watch come out to be in the range of 40-45 . I know I 'm not very precise , but then again , I 've be work out for a couple of year only . Thank you again ! Reply link do not work in your browser because JavaScript be disable . Reply Przemek February 13 , 2015 at 2:09 pm # 146 Your HRM be clearly above 185 ! Depending on the intensity of your soccer game , I would say your max be 200 or above 200 . If you want to check this , you need to test this in proper condition , race be best - assume you have a discipline in which you be technically efficient . Could be run , cycle , row . Any activity involve large muscle group . When it come to the calorie burn . I use FR 620 , Edge 810 and FR 910xt . Used to use FR 310xt and Edge 800 . Edge 810 be the most conservative ( report lowest value ) , then 310xt , then FR 620 , then 910xt . Having seen my VO2 consumption data at various HR percentage wise , I use the Weir formula to estimate caloric burn ( assume it be accurate at other than BMR level , I do not know it yet ) . I weight 74-75 , so about your range , but I be 38 . On the other hand , my VO2Max seem high ( 63ml/kg ) , which can be attribute to poor equipment calibration ( Cosmed mention above ) or , it could be real . I ca n't tell , plan to repeat it late this year with another provider . To make this short - assume your max HR be around 200 , average of 166 bpm be somewhere around 83 % HRM . My burn rate at 83 % HRM be around 820-850 kCals , include BMR ( take 50-60 kCals for that ) , accord to Weir formula . Having look at FR620 caloric burn over the last couple of week I think it be pretty consistent with my caloric burn estimate by Weir formula ( but not VO2Max data which suggest it be a high a 1000kCal / h ) . So I would rely on FR 620 in your case , too , but not Polar . Also , I log calorie eat each day - and I use to log Edge 810 caloric burn ( around 12-15 % low than FR 620 ) and should FR620/Edge 810 data be materially wrong ( 30 % would be material - your difference between Polar and FR620 ) , I would be lose weight . But I keep it . So FR 620/Edge 810 be roughly allright . I be plan to run some regression analysis of my data , but lack time to do this . Still , I think there be too many variable to be able to nail it really down and it be well to spend time elsewhere . Garmin get it pretty close to what we need .

In my last 10K race ( 30.01.2015 ) my Max HR be 190 , and it be important to mention that I be run at slow pace because it be my first race after 4 month battle ITBS .

There be a lot of protocol to do this . For now , I would use a 200 HRM , you can get as high a 194 during soccer , you must be able to go above that in all-max effort . The question be this - what do you want to use it for - to improve the calorie calculation in your watch - that may have no effect . If you want to establish your training zone - this be important , but that be not everything . Your lactate threshold be key . Again , you need to do some testing .

With the pulse-rate strap - 1:46:19 , 25.7 mile , average 14.50mph , max 31.54mph , average cadence 67 , max cadence 101 , average pulse 121 , max pulse 161 , calorie 567 Without the pulse-rate strap - 1:45:27 , 25.76 mile , average 14.57mph , max 30.35mph , average cadence 68 , max cadence 109 , calorie 1163 So factor in the pulse-rate reduce the calorie estimate by a factor of 2.05 ! At the time , I find that surprising . My cycling pulse-rate reach relatively high figure ( for my age ) , so Id have assume that , if anything , the with-pulse calorie figure would be high than the without-pulse figure .

Reply Dave Le Fevre March 5 , 2015 at 1:52 pm # 155 Im not really that concern by the calorie figure per se I only perform the experiment to quantify what difference ( if any ) the pulse-rate strap make . I suspect you must be pretty thin/small and/or with a high HRMax My mass be a bit under 62kg . My BMI be usually between 20.2 and 20.5 . My maximum pulse-rate be low , but be high for my age . Im 68 , so Id anticipate a maximum of 220-68=152 , yet I register about 15 more than that on steep climb . do you enter your weight , age , max HR and rest HR into your Garmin Weight and age , yes . HR figure , no . I intend to when I first configure it , but I have never yet find where to enter them . I notice that if I observe the HR % Max datum and do the sum , it assume that 100 % be 152 . So I assume that it do it own calculation of the maximum , and have no way of define the rest rate . I would burn around 900-950 kCals for a similar type of workout Its a hilly route , I wasnt go that fast , but Im not nearly a fast a some decade ago . So it not easy to compare . Though perhaps calories burn be simply a function of route , speed , mass , and be unconnected with age or how hard one find the ride .
