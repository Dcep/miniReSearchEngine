( Yfat Yossifor | The Bay City Times ) Print Andrew Dodson | adodson @ mlive.com By Andrew Dodson | adodson @ mlive.com The Bay City Times Email the author | Follow on Twitter on July 14 , 2014 at 7:15 AM , update September 09 , 2014 at 5:30 PM View/Post Comments BAY CITY , MI Bay City official say the switch to electronic `` smart meter '' for the city 's electric and water utility make operation more efficient and provide more usage transparency to resident . But a the $ 6.8 million program continue to roll out , it have cause headache and expensive plumbing bill for some resident . Terry Basmadjian , who life on Bay City 's West Side , say she pay $ 160 to have a plumber replace a valve that broke when her meter be swap out last week . Mark Niernberg , fear he would have to pay a similar , or high , bill , opt against switching his meter out for now , a the installer require resident to sign a waiver say the company be n't liable for any damage during the install . `` I 'm all for the new meter , but if they switch this out , I 'll likely have to hire a plumber to fix it , '' Niernberg say . `` If I have a plumber come out and update my water line , and then the city come in to install the meter , and something break , I would need to pay to have a plumber come out again and fix it . I think this whole notion that the homeowner be responsible be ridiculous . '' City official be now look into these issue to ensure the estimate 15,000 water meter can be instal by year 's end without costing customer hundred of dollar . `` As of now , I 've only hear of one formal complaint , '' say Bay City Manager Rick Finn . `` But I 've be tell there be some concern about the process . We need to look into this more before we make any decision on if we need to make some change . '' A Utility Partners of America truck park on McKinley Street include an attachment that say `` Contractor for Bay City . '' UPA have be switch out water meter to new smart meter for Bay City resident since April . ( Andrew Dodson | The Bay City Times ) Problems with the install When Terry Basmadjian sign the waiver , she do n't realize it include a sentence that say she would be liable for any damage that could occur during the installation process . `` I just think they need my permission to start the work , '' she say . Basmadjianis the step-mother to Bay City Commissioner Kerice Basmadjian , 7th Ward . Terry Basmadjianrealized the water valve be break when the installer try to turn water back on after swapping the meter . It be likely the first time the valve have be turn off since move into the residence , she say . `` The installer then tell me his company be n't responsible because I sign the waiver , '' Basmadjian say . After a $ 160 visit from Bay City-based Doug 's Plumbing , her valve be replace . Bob Dion , the city 's water distribution meter supervisor , say the city have receive about a dozen call per day from resident who experience a brokenvalve a a result of the smart meter install . `` These be old house , and many of them have n't exercise their valve ever , '' he say . `` They 've never be turn off , which be why they break easily . '' As a result , a resident end up hire a plumber that can cost up to hundred of dollar . Doug Trerice , owner of Doug 's Plumbing , say his company have replace about 100 valve since the water meter swap start . Trerice say old valve be make of brass , which be more susceptible to rust than modern valve , which be make of a strong type of alloy with Kaplan coat . `` We 've definitely be busy during this switch , '' he say . Trerice recommends resident exercise their valve at least once per year . `` When you turn them off , though , do it slowly , '' he say . `` When you turn it back on , also do it very slowly . '' Upcoming solution ? Terry Kilburn , the city 's water and sewer supervisor , say some resident have pay `` several '' hundred of dollar to plumber to have their valve repair , a a result of the smart meter rollout , prompt the city to act swiftly and find a solution . He say the city be look into create a program that would give resident a list of local plumber to replace the valve . Under the propose plan , plumber would submit a bid for the cost of a valve replacement , Kilburn say , and become an approve vendor of the city . `` Residents would be more comfortable if we can say , here 's a plumber and here 's how much it 's go to cost , instead of tell them to just call a plumber , '' Kilburn say . The resident would still pay for the valve replacement , Kilburn say . `` This be something that 's at the top of the list to act on , '' he say . `` It 's very important . '' Any program or ordinance change would require the approval of the Bay City Commission . A Bay City residential water meter . ( Times file ) Smart meter history and process The Bay City commission approve the upgrade to the smart meter system in October 2012 . The move mean few visit from meter reader and more detail to consumer about their usage . Using a radio transmitter , the meter sendinformation daily about homeowner ' electrical and water consumption to small tower place around the city , which bounce the data to city server . The system can alert city utility official earlier than the exist system of irregularusage , such a a major leak underground that could cost resident big dollar . `` If someone be out of town and their pipe burst , we 'll receive an alert that show a spike in usage , allow u to respond and turn off the water before it become a big problem , '' say Dion . `` If that happen today , we 'd rely on resident call u say that there 's water come out of the basement windows of their neighbor 's house . '' The $ 6.8 million upgrade be pay for use money from a 2008 bond sale and electric and water rate , say George Martini , the city 's fiscal service director . The bond be expect to be pay off by the end of next year . The Bay City Commission recently approve a rate increase of $ 3 to the customer service charge and 11-cents on the usage unit of 100 cubic foot of water . There be four city employee swap out meter for business and industrial property , but most resident will see a Utility Partners of America truck park outside their home . UPA , base in Greenville , S.C. , be hire base on recommendation from Badger Meter , the Wisconsin-based company that manufacture the smart meter . Dion say city employee could n't handle the sheer volume of replacing all water meter , prompt the city to hire a third-party . Electric meter swap start in February and be more than 80 percent complete . Water meter swap , which start in April , be about 20 percent complete . `` We 're a little behind , but still think we can finish up the work by the end of the year , '' say Dion . Once electric meter be swap , those worker will transition to water meter , say Dion . Representatives from an out-of-state call center be call resident to schedule one-hour appointment windows to install the new meter and radio transmitter . Houses with updated meter only require the installation of the handheld-sized transmitter , which take about 20 minute . Installation of a new meter can take up to an hour and require turn water off in the household for about a half hour , say Dion . `` The big hold up be try to get people at their house when an installer can be there , '' Dion say . `` We need an adult at the house in order to do the install . '' Job concern Despite some of the benefit of smart meter , some resident be question why the city need them . `` Do we really need them ? '' ask Bob Philip , who have his meter recently replace . `` That and how many job be they eliminate ? The city do n't need more job loss . '' According to Finn , the city will eliminate four of it five meter reader position , beginning next fiscal year , which start July 1 , 2015 . All five meter reader be budget to stay on the payroll for the current fiscal year , which start July 1 . Once the entire system be online , the position would be phase out if an employee opt to leave during the current fiscal year , say Martini . It cost about $ 85,500 per meter reader with salary and fringe benefit , say Martini . Meter reader , who check water and electric meter , earn between $ 17.35 to $ 18.98 per hour and receive medical benefit from the city . The city will keep one meter reader on to deal with any glitch with the new smart meter system , say Finn . Savings from the four eliminate position work out to about $ 342,000 for next fiscal year . Martini say the city would work to find other position in the water or electric department for impact employee . Other concern It 's not just break water valve that be rub resident the wrong way during the transition to smart meter . Ray Armstrong say his meter have make a loud click noise , but city official have tell him it would be replace . Others say they 're concern about possible health issue due to the transmitter that sends off usage data to the city 's server . `` I 've have resident call me say the transmitter be a real concern for them , '' say Commissioner Elizabeth Peters , 2 nd Ward . Kim Haken , manager of Columbus Laundromat , which recently have to pay a $ 15,000 water bill after the city instal an incorrect meter reader and an ongoing clerical error , say city official tell her a new meter could increase her water bill . Kilburn say that could be the case , but the new meter could also work in favor of the customer . `` If their meter be run slow before , it would benefit the city , '' he say . `` But if it be run fast , it would benefit the customer . '' Bay City Commission President , Lori Dufresne . Bay City Commission President Lori Dufresne , 4 th Ward , say she have have a resident complain about the meter be too loud and others about the waiver process a part of installation . `` I guess it 's one of those thing that we need more discussion on in order to smooth it out and make it feel easy for the resident , '' she say . Personally , Dufresne , who work in Midland , say it be difficult for her to schedule a time to coordinate with a scheduler to install the meter . `` It 's a challenge to find a convenient time , '' she say . Several resident interview acknowledged the professionalism of the installers from UPA . `` We have a young kid come to the house and he be very open with me , '' Nierenberg say . `` When I tell him I be n't go to sign the waiver because I do n't want to deal with a break valve , he even agree with me and tell me that I should get a plumber to look at it first . '' Finn say opt out of the smart meter program wo n't be encourage , but it be possible . Residents who decide against the new technology , however , would have to pay hefty fee for a meter reader to come to their residence each month . `` When we show the cost of a monthly reading to a resident , it become obvious pretty quickly that it 's not in their best fiscal interest , '' he say .
