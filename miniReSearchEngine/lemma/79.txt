Feb 5 , 2009 2:17AM 45 comment Share and Print : Hail foodie ! I 'm in the process of building a new home , and closing in on decision time for the kitchen ... My previous home , all I 've ever have be a gas range top so I 've get use to taking control of the flame for grant . This time around , natural gas be not available so I 'd have to have a propane tank instal and pip run , which would total about $ 1200 give or take ( not include the propane gas ! ) Is it worth it to spend the money , or be the electric radiant range adequate these day ? Do they give you more heat control than the old day ? I 'm guess they 're not good at instant-off ... hehe . I 'm not a chef or anything like that , but I always like to try to do thing `` right '' where I can . Any advice or thought appreciate ! Talk be close , but that do n't mean the conversation have to stop !
