We use SRP a our electric company and be on the 1pm-8pm plan . I recently go online to browse the sight and find the estimation tool , well , to my surprise for 9 day of electric my estimate bill be $ 220 . Now I know the electric bill would be high here than in my previous state ( NJ ) but that amount be a shock to me . We be a family of four , run the pool filter about 5 hour a day ( off peak ) and leave the air on 80 when we r home and 86 when we r out . Washer and dryer only use off peak a well and use every other day . We use a crock pot , grill , stave top for dinner and try to avoid use the oven . Lights r on only when need and TV usage be a couple of hour a day ( peak & off peak combine ) . We have try to be as diligent a possible , be we miss something ? ? Any hint or suggestion would be greatly appreciate ! ! Thanks Kim 10-04-2010 , 04:02 AM lyzzard 382 post , read 882,846 time Reputation : 253 Did you have to put down a deposit ? Have you check your attic ? Is it blaze hot ? Or be it cold ? If it 's cold , you have an A/C leak . Do you have fan in the attic ? Do you have double pan window ? Do you have any type of covering on them ? Are you north/south face or east/west ? We have 1850 sq ft 2 story house and our bill be around $ 280 ( down $ 60 from last month ) , but I keep it cool at night ( around 72 ) and 80 during the day , no pool . Our house be north/south facing with double pan window and covering on the west face one . We also have APS and not SRP . The winter not only bring nicer weather , but low electric bill a well . 10-04-2010 , 06:45 AM jambo101 21,060 post , read 18,061,122 time Reputation : 15260 If your hot water heater be electric you may want to turn the temperature down to 100-110 degree a you 'll probably find it up at about 150 degree . I , ve turn mine down to 100 and it only drawback be you have to wait a few hour between people take a shower but on the plus side that electric meter wheel certainly doesnt spin so fast so often . That pool could be another source of energy output a pump and heater take up power , you may want to reduce the time you run pump , filter and heater . 10-04-2010 , 07:26 AM Desertspiritsteve 537 post , read 739,435 time Reputation : 523 Put a time clock on the water heater and run it off peak . I think you can have an energy audit on the house by SRP . That bill seem really high for such high temperature . Most of the bill be AC . Maybe an old unit or leaky duct . 10-04-2010 , 07:41 AM observer53 14,611 post , read 18,877,261 time Reputation : 6736 Check for airtightness of door and windows . I 've not use that `` estimation tool '' before , so I do n't know if there could have be an issue with that perform incorrectly . That `` estimate bill '' seem ridiculously high . 10-04-2010 , 09:18 AM MaxPower123 Location : Phoenix 674 post , read 1,589,539 time Reputation : 260 $ 220 be way too much , be you sure they be n't estimate your bill for the whole month base on 9 day of usage ? 10-04-2010 , 09:20 AM rjrcm Location : Tempe , Arizona 4,511 post , read 7,809,704 time Reputation : 2111 I 'm with observer53 , that sound extremely high for 9 day . Before you get too concern , I 'd wait to see what your first real bill look like . We be also start to hit cooler weather , so AC cost should start drop . Edit : I agree , probably a monthly estimate base on your 9 day usage . That would be much more reasonable . 10-04-2010 , 09:54 AM twiggy 3,885 post , read 6,555,531 time Reputation : 1436 It 's the heat ! It 's really expensive to cool a house , ready for a shocker , I be a large household of course with 6 , in a 4 bedroom , 2 story with a pool . I do have a lot of electric plugged in but my bill in the summer month be 700.00 a month . I bust my but , like you try to low it but when winter hit it drop by 500.00 dollar . So , it 's must be the air conditioner . Some people have a house that be more efficient but in reality , most home here be build shotty and do n't hold in the cool air , leave most of u with extreme cool bill . I try to warn newcomer of how much more it be to cool a home here but get tell I 'm just a bummer and hate this state . For some reason on here most have really efficient home and low electric bill but amongst my friend and neighbor it 's pretty high for all of u . Your bill will most likely be around 4 to 500 dollar a month in the summer , but it will lower considerably in the winter month . Maybe around 175 , etc . Sorry you find out this way , but like I always say , AZ be know for it 's cheap house but that do n't mean it will cheap to live here . We have other cost and our pay be usually low . Some people will not have this issue , but it 's more common to have it than not to have it . If you get on the plan that total it for the year and let you evenly spread it out over 12 month you will be able to at least judge what the total will be ever month . So , instead of the ups and down , you have 350 every month . Then at least you can plan for it because some winter month can get hot enough to raise the bill when your not expect it and if you be on any kind of a budget , it 's not a pleasant surprise . All the tip on here be good , I 've try them , but they do n't really make much of a difference . Instead of 735.00 our bill be , 703.00 . Nice to save 30 dollar but not the saving you be hop for . It 's just an AZ house and that mean you be cool the whole neighborhood with everyone else . lol Sure , you can live with nothing plug in the whole summer , and the air at 90 but who can really do that ? It would be miserable ! It cost more to cool than to heat your home because everything electric in your home , appliance , etc . be also give off heat . It 's an uphill battle , one reason we dread summer . But the good news be you 're find this out at the end of summer , and by Dec. you will see low bill for sure . Just plan for it come May . Now you know you will have to make room for the ac bill in your budget . Next time , try rent a house thats only 2 year old , that might help with all the `` electric saving '' new energy efficient item that have come out recently but they be usually far out lie and the drive will be long . So , well to plan for the bill . On a good note , it 's a dry heat ! lol 10-04-2010 , 10:01 AM observer53 14,611 post , read 18,877,261 time Reputation : 6736 220 must be your monthly estimate , but frankly , even that seems high , a careful a you be be . If that 's the actual bill at the end of the month ( and with cooler weather start this week , it may not be ) then I agree with the energy audit . Then , the year round manage payment plan make sense , also . Twiggy , 700 a month be an insane electric bill , even in the size house you describe . Have you consider an energy audit yourself ? ( I do n't know what your thermostat setting be ) . 10-04-2010 , 11:37 AM Lovegun 300 post , read 575,975 time Reputation : 102 Since your renting your home , there be n't much you can do ... Replace a much bulb a you can with CFL , maybe buy some weather strip for window and door . Unplug any charger , DVD/blu-ray player , game console when there not in use . They can use a small amount of electricity even when not in use . Change your fridge to the energy saver option . Try to use laptop instead of desktop computer , they use less electricity . My bill be 160 last month . I have a 13 seer a/c unit , mostly CFL , energy efficient appliance . 1500sq foot home . Air be on 82 during day , 78 at night .
