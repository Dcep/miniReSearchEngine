Sustainable Energy - without the hot air : How to boil water Sustainable Energy - without the hot air Sunday , October 19 , 2008 How to boil water A friend tell me he 'd be fight with his kitchen-cohabitants over the question of whether to simply use the gas to make hot water for pasta , or whether to use the kettle , then put it in the pot . To answer this question quantitatively , I do some experiment and I 've write a new webpage , How much be inside HOT WATER ? The page assume that the motivation be to save energy . The conclusion apply to Britain today and to similar country . My conclusion be that use the gas hob be slightly well in energy term than use the kettle ; but my recommend behaviour depends on the time of year . In the winter , if you would like to have more heat in your kitchen , then use the gas hob alone be definitely best ; in the heat of summer , use the kettle may be preferable . Disclaimers , small print ... If your motivation be to save money then the answer will depend on your fuel price . If your motivation be to cook the pasta a fast a possible then you should use neither method alone - you should use both the kettle and the hob , with roughly half in each . Posted by David MacKay FRS at 12:59 PM 16 comment : Iain say ... A relate common source of argument be the question of whether to fill the pan and/or kettle from the hot or cold tap . However , a an article in the New York Times explains , the hot tap should be avoid for health and safety reason . October 19 , 2008 at 1:44 PM Gavin say ... Nice research - but I have an electric ( ceramic ) hob , should I use that or the kettle ? October 20 , 2008 at 5:22 AM David MacKay say ... @ gavin - I do n't know ; I expect it 's very close ; can you do the experiment and let u know ? October 20 , 2008 at 10:38 AM Alex say ... Hi , former student here , I remember your lecture well , and am still a convince Bayesian . Anyway , how much water do you use ? Can you say what % of the energy consume actually be need to heat the water from the initial temperature to 100C ? Also , in Japan they have kettle that keep the water hot at around 80C ( or hot if desire ) and let you decant it a and when desire . This struck me a be ludicrously inefficient . Perhaps though with adequate insulation it might not be , compare to a method in which you boil a slightly excessive amount of water from cold for each pot of tea . Any thought ? October 23 , 2008 at 4:48 AM tapolak say ... David , I have have the same debate , but with respect to cofee & tea , not pasta . I just repeat your experiment , but I use a standard hob kettle on my gas stove . Measured 0.73 cuft = 0.22 kWh gas to take 1 litre of water from 12 degC to full boiling . Using your calcs , that be about 25 % less than the electric kettle us at the power station . I reckon that maybe a saucepan ( a you use ) waste about 30 % more energy by heat flow up the side . Note I use a fairly small gas ring - if I have use a large one it would no doubt have be a bit more wasteful . Anyway , on straight energy term , the gas kettle be significantly well . Plus I get the bonus of an extra 0.1 kWh approx of heat in my home . Rgds Sandy October 28 , 2008 at 2:07 AM Oliver say ... I 've wonder about this on and off for age : thanks very much Oliver Morton ( on hot tap : surely relatively few home have lead in pipe now ? ) October 29 , 2008 at 4:34 AM Ecorenovation say ... And what about the microwave ! ! October 31 , 2008 at 10:07 AM Jeremy Bickerstaffe say ... Your analysis do n't include the efficiency of the gas distribution network . How much gas energy be lose by sending it to your house ? November 4 , 2008 at 2:17 AM Chris Brown say ... Microwave ? I attemped a simple experiment , boil a single cup of water ( 350ml ) for my tea , use the same kind of energy meter that David use . My 3Kwh kettle consume 0.04 kWh of electricity to boil the water pour into it from the cup . The 900W Microwave consume 0.07 kWh of electricity to boil the water in the tea cup . November 10 , 2008 at 2:31 AM Compost John say ... I love this blog and would like there to be a 'followers ' button , like I have on mine http : //lowcarbonlifestyle.blogspot.com/ ( scroll down , in the right-hand column ) When you have this application , I 'll become a follower and will be notify when you post . Currently you be in my 'favourites ' list ! I boil water on my smokefree woodstove , which us virtually ( fossil ) carbon-free fuel ( brought to my house use cycle trailer ) , chop either by hand with bowsaw ( embody energy here ) or with my electric chainsaw ( embody energy here too , but leccy from 'Good Energy'.. 100 % renewables ) . I use the microwave to heat water in individual cup when the stove 's not lit , a the water heat be just that in the cup , whereas in a kettle , you heat usually more than one cup ... But , if I heat one cup to instant coffee temperature , it take 2 minute . Two cup take 3 minute and three cup take just 3 and a half minutes ... so this should be take into consideration when decide to use the electric kettle , gas hob or microwave to heat water . I look forward to reading more post on this important subject ! John Cossham , York , UK December 21 , 2008 at 2:08 PM Philip Machanick say ... Gavin , let 's see how far we can go with David 's number . The total transaction with the kettle+gas stove be 0.36kWh . We should adjust this for the electric hob but the difference will be small ( a fraction of 0.06 ) so let 's use this a a baseline . The total energy need to make the water boil on an electric hob be the same a the kettle , less energy leakage from less efficient energy transfer . The first number be 0.3kWh , so a long a the energy transfer be at least 83 % efficient ( with respect to kettle=100 % ) , the stovetop method will be competitive . That number be not only a property of the stove but also the container , a a container with good thermal conductivity on the base than the side and lid will give good result . I suspect you would get good result overall if you train everyone to like their pasta al dente , so they cook it on average for 10 % less time . December 23 , 2008 at 4:55 PM madeleine.rampling say ... I be have an 'on-going- argument ... ! ! I have be happily use the Gas hob with a Prestige Whisteling Kettle for the last 5 year a the worktop space have always beens tres limitee in my kitchen in France.I am tell I be mad..wasting MONEY and ENERGY 'cos it take a ) longer b ) cost more to boil it on a gas hob . I disagree ! but then I be a female and English ... and the stove top space be only use when cook al dente pasta and make stock ... petit poi spinache etc ! ! Help I 'm feed up with be make to feel a total Idiot when I 'm not so sure ! ! Mado December 6 , 2009 at 6:41 AM alfacento say ... I 've be wonder about this for a while : there a lot to think about when your making a cuppa ! So , Mado , and anyone else wonder ... Reveiwing whats be say above , the amount of energy people have measure in thier home that it take to boil a litre of water be : Gas hob ( small ring ) = 0.22kWh Electric kettle = 0.11kWh In the uk gas cost about 0.05/kWh , and Elctricity about 0.14/kWh , so ... thats go to cost you about : 1.1 penny ( gas ) , or 1.5 penny ( electric ) . ( nb . In France electrcity be about 4.3 Euro cents/kWh , so it will cost about 0.5 Euro cent to boil a litre in your electric kettle ... ) If it only cost you 're interested in then it a simple a that . ( Assuming you only boil the amount you need and switch the hob off a soon a the water boil ) Energy , though , be not create equally - Gas normally come straight from source , eg by drilling into the earth and take it , whilst electricity on the other hand can be generate in many way . By far the most common in the world be coal or gas fire power station . ( about 75 % of electricity generation in the uk ) France however , generate a 75 % of it electricity from Nuclear power station , whist some country such a Norway generate 95 % of thier electricity from Renewables ( Hydro-electric ) . So although your kettle be consume the same kWh of electricity , the effect it be have on the climate , pollution etc will be very different depending which country you 're in . A coal or gas power station be about 30-40 % efficient , mean that for every unit of electricity you use in your home , at least 3 time as much energy have be use ( in the form of coal or gas ) to generate it ! So then the amount of coal or gas that be burnt to boil your litre of water in the electric kettle become about 0.33kWh and the `` greener '' option would seem to be gas . Its a complex one . The economics be simple enough , but to really figure it out you need to know where the energy you use come from , how it produce , transport , how much be lose along the way etc etc . However it all out there on the internet if you have the time/incination ! Heres a couple of informative link : http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_energy http : //www.aepuk.com/need_info.php As a closing point , just to put the number we 're talk about into context , if you rig up your bike/rowing machine or similar with a modern , efficient electric generator , assume you 're a healthy fit human , you could produce electricity at a rate of about 100Watts . You would need to keep pedalling/rowing at this rate ( hard ! ) for over an hour to produce the same 1.5 penny worth of electricity you 're kettle us in 3 minute boil a litre of water ... Hope that help ! Mark , Edinburgh . December 16 , 2009 at 1:29 PM Justin say ... This comment have be remove by a blog administrator . March 7 , 2010 at 8:13 AM heavyweather say ... How about induction heater ... March 21 , 2011 at 3:33 AM Paul Mott say ... It 's a shame that the appliance manufacturer , who sell `` coolwall '' toaster , do n't sell double-insulated ( physically , not electrically ! ) kettle . Many folk , myself include , have plumb that mean hot water for the basin take a long time to flow from the hot tap , and entail the inefficient heating up of a long run of copper pip ( and it content ) - undesirable in summer . So we use a part-full kettle , and boil it rather often a an instant source of hot water for cleaning crockery etc . This would be a far more energy efficient act if kettle be sell with good thermal insulation ( e.g . two separate plastic skin ) .
