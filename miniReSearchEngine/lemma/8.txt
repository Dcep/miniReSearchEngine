Called and get a new head sent out free of charge . Turns out , the second one stopped working too and after 30 second late , we have a whole new vacuum on the way . Honestly , this be the best customer service I have ever experience . add your response Helpful ? Yes No Linda of De Soto , IL on Feb. 5 , 2015 Satisfaction Rating I be amaze every time I use my Shark Navigator by the amount of dust and dirt it pick up from what I think to be a clean carpet . I buy one for myself and talk my father in law into purchase one for their home a well and he be amaze when I clean his house weekly at just how much stuff end up in the canister . I love the way the head swivel to easily get under furniture and the ease of use . Also , love the fact that I can lift off the canister and carry it with the tool to get in hard to reach place . I could do my own info commercial on this product . In fact , I buy a 2nd one that I 'm keep in the box just in case something go wrong with my first one . add your response Helpful ? Yes No jenny of Randleman , NC on Feb. 1 , 2015 Satisfaction Rating I love my Shark . It really pick up the dirt deep in the carpet . I know because it take no time to fill up the canister . The Shark begin to give me electrical shock and I really think maybe it have something to do with static in the air but it get worse . I have to be careful where I touch the vacuum when vacuum . Then one day it stop shock me - the same day the roller brush stop work . I have contact the company with no response . I own my vacuum for only 3 month . This be the first expensive vacuum I have own and what a waste of money . I will return to buying less expensive vacuum . Would rather have 3 $ 60.00 vacuum than one good one that be defective . Wish I have keep the receipt . add your response Helpful ? Yes No Lucaya of Clarksville , TN on Jan. 30 , 2015 Satisfaction Rating My husband and I purchase a Shark Navigator Lift-Away Pro , Model Number NV355 approximately nine month ago . Within only a few month , the brush roll begin to rattle and even when completely clean , the vacuum would only work on carpet for a few minute . I call on January 7th to use the warranty to replace or repair the unit . I be notify at the time that my only two option be to either spend an additional $ 100 for a new vacuum , or pay nearly that same amount in shipping and handling for the vacuum to be send to the ONLY repair location in the country , California . My husband and I be both military , and money be extremely tight . I fail to see the value of a warranty that penalize customer after less than a year of own a vacuum that DOES NOT WORK . I voice my concern to the phone operator , Julianne , and request to speak to a manager . Julianne notify me that there be no manager currently work , which I find incredibly difficult to believe . I then request to speak with a District Manager . Julianne again state that not only could she not connect me with that individual , but she do not even have their information . She tell me that I would be contact by a manager within 24-48 hour . I wait over five day before hearing anything , receive a voice mail during a family emergency . After settle our family affair , I call the number back on January 29th , and be tell that the same manager , ( Sarah ) , who attempt to contact me in Mid-January be currently come back from lunch and that I would have to hang up and she would call me back in 5-10 minute . While someone do call back , I be unable to reach the phone . I call back immediately and be notify by another phone representative that they have absolutely no idea who Sarah be , that there be no manager currently work , there be no method for telephone operator to transfer a call to a manager , and that I would have to hang up and wait another 24-48 hour for a manager to get in contact with me . I would like to state that this be the absolute WORST business model I have EVER hear of concerning customer support . The point of a customer like myself call implies that this be the time they be available to talk about the problem they be have , be force to wait for an arbitrary phone call that may or may not even happen implies that Shark do not care about their customer or their integrity . Being tell several time that there be no manager currently work , and even if they be work , the phone representative have no method of get in contact with them alert me to the possibility that Shark may not be operate within the standard of federal law . Not only be the Shark vacuum the bad vacuum I have ever buy , but it warranty be worthless and call the customer help line be an exercise in futility . DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY , YOU WILL REGRET IT ! add your response Helpful ? Yes No Evelyn of San Diego , CA on Jan. 30 , 2015 Satisfaction Rating I have a shark navigator . It be only a couple year old . I find it have a 5 year warranty . Something inside broke ( I could hear it rattle ) ; it 's the 'kickstand ' feature that allow the vacc to 'click into place ' and ( for lack of a good description ) , pop a wheelie so you can wheel it around . The bottom part ( call the power nozzle ) just kind of flopped off the end of the unit . You have to pick the whole thing up to move from room to room . So ... try to first take care of it myself ( rather than , I presume , ship it somewhere and leave me without a vacc for x # of day ) , I bring it to my local vacc repair shop . They could n't fix it but show me the part that have crack , and advise me to contact the manufacturer for repair . So I call ... and ( try to be helpful ) tell them I know what be wrong with it - I have save them some time and bring it somewhere . DEAD SILENCE . `` You what ? ? ? '' `` I bring it to a vacc place '' . `` Well - you just void your warranty . '' WTF ? I say `` be you kid , '' he say NO . Seriously ? ? ? I say `` well let 's pretend this conversation do n't happen and I 'll call back . '' No can do . BOY this 'helpful agent ' ( not ) be be really hard-nosed . Bottom line : they would not honor the warranty ! Merely because I do some advance legwork . They offer to sell me a replacement ( probably refurbish ) , for $ 29.99 . NO THANK YOU . A few month late my niece have the same problem with hers ( buy around the same time ) . I say `` do n't take it anywhere '' so she do n't . She call and report it . After a long conversation the 'helpful agent ' say `` I 'll just send you a whole new unit . '' A new vacuum ? YES ! ( she figure by now there be lot of people complain about this ) . The box arrive . The co. only send a POWER NOZZLE ! She call the company and they refuse to honor the promise make by the agent . They say `` we do n't send new vacuum out for free '' ( but this be to replace their defective unit ! ) . They offer to sell her a new one at a reduce price - $ 70 or so . This be a classic bait and switch . ( do n't they realize there be more to lose , by not honor what the agent promise to do ? If they 'd send a new vacc we would both be sing their praise , I would be write a glowing review ... instead of me write this novel ) . So she be stuck with just the new brush attachment . IN ADDITION TO THIS , this company be NOT reachable by email , you ca n't reply back to the transaction receipt they send , and the 'live chat ' be worthless when the person/robot you be live-chatting with ... keep refer you to their 800 number . I will not be buy another one of their product and neither will my niece . add your response Helpful ? Yes No Sherry of White Hall , AR on Jan. 26 , 2015 Satisfaction Rating I order the Shark Rotator Power Lift-away vacuum online directly from Shark on 1/15/15 . I immediately receive an email state my order be on backorder with no estimate for delivery give . Today almost two week late I call phone number in my email , be only able to use the automate system still on backorder with no estimate delivery date . I try several time to speak to a human but my call would somehow always end before I be connect . Meanwhile I continue to see the infomercial on TV several time every day . I call the number to order and the saleslady have no knowledge of the backorder situation , a far a she know the product be available . I tell her I have be unable to speak to anyone when I call the customer service number so she offer to connect me , same problem I be never connect to a human , grrr ! I finally used the live chat link from my email and after a lengthy wait an agent come online . I ask her if I make an order by phone and cancel my online order if I would get it sooner . She say , no it would be on backorder either way . She estimate my order would ship in 4-6 week ! I have not be charge any money a I pay through PayPal and wo n't be charge until it ship , thank goodness . Most website tell you upfront if a product be on backorder . It seem unethical to keep take order that wo n't be fill for that long without tell the customer upfront . Anyone considering order this should be warn you may be wait to get your order for much long than when you order from most company . add your response Helpful ? Yes No Craig of Colorado Springs , CO on Jan. 21 , 2015 Satisfaction Rating CUSTOMER SERVICE ... . First attempt : I be attempt to acquire the mailing address to send in my Shark vacuum for repair . The power head stop work and be inform I need to send in the entire unit . Try and find a box to ship , what fun and 36 dollar shipment .

The phone number I be give by the live chat person at about 1:30 MST ( Amanda ? ? ) connect me to ( 1 800 798-7398 ) a national directory . After several minute with her , I be transfer to C/S .

After wait for about 30 minute for an email , I again attempt the live chat session to address my issue . I be third in line and after several minute , I be connect with Julie . As I be type in my request , my session be terminate . So far very lousy customer service over all . I access Live Chat again ( about 2:30 MST ) and speak with Jory . I explain I need the address to send in my Shark Vacuum for repair . The person at Customer Service ( Valerie ) be not very helpful at all . I be able to get a partial address ; EURO something at one something Genesis Way , Spring Pine , NC.28777 . Jory be prompt and give me the Address . WOW . For such an awesome product to have such lousy C/S ... I be shock . Please include my comment in your survey . NOT HAPPY ! ! ! add your response Helpful ? Yes No Robert of Sebastian , FL on Jan. 18 , 2015 Satisfaction Rating Bought a Shark Rotator Pro ( NV502Q ) about 6 month ago . The suction elbow release latch that hold the elbow in place vanish and need to be replace with about a 10 cent replacement piece . Went to the Shark online Chat and tell them what I need . I get the same response that another reviewer previously get and that be , for the 10 cent piece , I either need to box up the unit and send it to them for repair and then pay the freight both way - for them to snap on a clip ! Of course , my other choice be to buy a new unit ( REALLY ? ! ) at a discount . This be ** ! I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND A SHARK UNIT TO ANYONE AS A RESULT OF THIS EASILY AVOIDABLE SITUATION . THIS be what be wrong with the world . Poor judgement , poor diagnosis and solution to the problem . Wonder why thing cost so much ? I do n't ! add your response Helpful ? Yes No faye of Gladstone , OR on Jan. 12 , 2015 Satisfaction Rating I order the vacuum the first of October . They say the first payment and ship and handling would be take out in the first 24 hour and the vacuum would be deliver in 4 to 6 week . Well , I wait and wait for the $ 105.00 to be take out . So by December , when it still be n't take out , I decide I be n't go to be get it , so I use the money for Christmas . December 24th I get a surprise . I be overdraw in my bank like $ 95.00 . They have finally take out the money without any warn . But on the bright side , I get the vacuum a few day late . add your response Helpful ? Yes No Jeremiah of Laporte , TX on Jan. 6 , 2015 Satisfaction Rating A small red button on the nv-501 model broke . It hold the hose elbow in place but with out it , the hose just come out make the rather expensive vacuum nonfunctioning . I call customer support . They inform me that the small button be not a replacement price they offer . Now this small button could not cost 1/2 to 1 cent to make . So their solution be offer me a discount on a new unit of 75 dollar off . The vacuum be less then 6 month old . This be ridiculous and now I wish I would have pop the extra money for the dyson . add your response Helpful ? Yes No Richard of Poquoson , VA on Jan. 3 , 2015 Satisfaction Rating After 7 month the motorize floor brush roller on my NV 355 fail to function .

Yes No Eve of Hilltop , MN on Dec. 23 , 2014 Satisfaction Rating My vacuum 's motor start to go out and I call customer support - no resolution . And then it completely go out so I call customer support again and ask them what can I do about it . They ask me to send the vacuum back and my own expense . Then they offer me to get a discount vacuum cleaner for $ 100 and I just felt a though why would I pay for another vacuum when there 's clearly something wrong with my vacuum cleaner . I think their service suck and it 's a rip off . I pay 200 dollar only to pay another hundred dollar . That 's ridiculous . add your response Helpful ? Yes No Joe of Hartsville , TN on Dec. 22 , 2014 Satisfaction Rating I order a Shark Navigator Vacuum after watch the infomercial on television . I order it over the phone and ask for the six monthly installment of $ 49.95 . I be told I would be charge the first monthly payment of 4995 before the vacuum would be ship . I agree and they assure me back it would be ship within nine business day . The vacuum be deliver within the nine business day . When I receive my credit card bill I be charge the full amount of $ 389.50 . I notify Shark of the error and be inform by Shark that there be nothing they could do to correct the problem . They tell me that because it be already charge they could not correct the problem . They say the only thing they could do be give me a 20 % discount off the total . I do not understand why they can not credit my account for the $ 389.50 and then charge me the monthly installment a promise . Unfortunately I do not read the customer review prior to my purchase . This be clearly a mistake make by Shark and not by me when the order be take . It be also clear that the order taker over the phone tell me I would be charge the first monthly installment prior to the back and be ship so it be clear I be suppose to be charge monthly installments and not the lump sum . Obviously this be no way to do business . Unfortunately this have happen to me and would like other buyer to be aware . Also I would like buyer to be aware that they be unwilling to correct their mistake . Thank you for ... add your response Helpful ?

Yes No horace h. of San Francisco , Other on Dec. 7 , 2014 Satisfaction Rating SHARK PRODUCTS ARE THROW AWAY JUNK , December 6 , 2014 . This review be from : Shark Navigator Upright Vac ( Kitchen ) . Shark product be all GARBAGE . We have own a few , suckered to purchase by their slick advertising , and ALL be JUNK after a short period of time . A very poorly make product in the most general sense . This company personify the throw away mentality , but even so , it should not be shortly after purchase . These product be make to last a long a it take you to exit the store . Keep your receipt . I buy some at Bed , Bath and Beyond because they have a very consumer friendly return policy , and I know they would take them back when they break , or in the case of the handhelds , when the battery stop charge .

When I go to purchase all the attachment be miss in the itemized section . So I call and they tell me that would cost me another $ 100 dollar , even though they advertise it a $ 249 total for this model with attachment list . Online chat disconnect me when I ask to speak to manager . Rep be just read from script . I even cut and paste their own advertisement from their own website and it mean nothing to the rep . I try to call the 800 number and get the same response . I be transfer to another department and hung up on before they even take the call . I be excite to buy this vacuum but refuse to give my money to a company that have no respect for it customer . I believe this be call bait and switch ! I will pay the extra and buy Dyson . add your response Helpful ? Yes No Douglas of Clermont , FL on Nov. 28 , 2014 Satisfaction Rating Shark cordless 18-volt less than 9-months old . The rotator attachment stop rotate so I remove the four screw to identify any problem . Just like any standard upright vacuum that have a rotating brush , it be manufacture with a BELT to rotate the brush head . Any other vacuum offer replacement belt . It 's normal wear and tear a they begin to stretch out . I call the Mfg direct and they do not sell the belt alone , instead they only offer a replacement rotator assembly for 27.95 which include ship . The whole vacuum itself only cost $ 60 .

I contact Shark about their 5 yr VIP warranty and be tell that I have 2 option : 1 . ) to ship it back to them and have a new one return to me at my own expense or 2 . ) they will give me a discount on the purchase of a new vacuum . I 'm sorry but what good be a warranty if I have to pay for shipping which will most likely cost me $ 80+ .
