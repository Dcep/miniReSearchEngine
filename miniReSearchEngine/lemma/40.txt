For power outage , we can equip your Sun Frost refrigerator with a non-interruptible power supply ! Sun Frost refrigerator and freezer be so outstandingly energy-efficient , power a home with solar power or other low output energy source be both feasible and affordable . All model be available in 12 , 24 , or 48 volt DC , or 110 , 220 volt AC . Even in a home use conventional utility power , energy consumption for refrigeration be typically cut by a factor of five ! ( ARTICLE ) Sun Frost participate in the U.S. government ENERGY STAR program , and several of our model bear the ENERGY STAR label . Visit the ENERGY STAR web site at http : //www.energystar.gov . In addition to unrivaled energy efficiency , Sun Frost offer amenity not find in conventional refrigerator , such a high humidity , food-saving storage , ultra-quiet operation and an easy-to-clean interior . Every Sun Frost be custom craft - you choose the hinge side and finish . Your Sun Frost can be finish with a number of laminate or wood finish . We be now also offer a stainless steel option .

Download Sun Frost refrigerator brochure a a PDF file ( require Adobe Acrobat Reader ) Efficiency - Plus The Sun Frost refrigerator employ an array of important innovation to achieve it exceptionally low energy consumption . The cooling system on the Sun Frost be top mount . This reduces energy consumption several way . The heat generate by the compressor and condenser ( black coil on the back of many refrigerator ) do not reenter the refrigerator , and with a cooler-running condenser the efficiency of the cooling system be increase . Made in the USA Quiet Operation The condenser on Sun Frost refrigerator and freezer be cool passively , except our RF19 and F19 model , which use a quiet and highly efficient fan to help cool the condenser . Because of the efficient design of the Sun Frost , the compressor use run less often , be much small and produce correspondingly less noise than those find on a conventional refrigerator . These feature make the Sun Frost much quiet than a conventional AC refrigerator . Simple Defrost System Defrosting a Sun Frost be a simple process . Frost build-up in the Sun Frost freezer be very slow because there be no air circulate between the freezer and refrigerator section . The ice that form in the freezer collect primarily on the ceiling . When defrost the freezer section , the content of the freezer may be transfer to the refrigerator section so they remain freeze . After the refrigerator have be turn off for about twenty minute , the ice be easily remove in large piece . There be no mop-up because the ice do not need to be melt , only separate from the flat ceiling . Superior Storage Conditions Sun Frost refrigerator keep food fresher by maintaining high humidity . This prevents freezer burn and wilt cause by water loss . In a SUN FROST , food often last two to three time long than in conventional refrigerator . In typical refrigerator , the water contain in food be transform into ice on the freezer 's cooling coil . This process result in the dehydration of fruit and vegetable , increase energy consumption , and accelerate frost buildup . In a conventional refrigerator , high humidity be achieve by storing food in airtight container , which create high humidity condition , but cut off the food ' oxygen supply . Without oxygen , plant cell break down anaerobically , decrease shelf life . The Sun Frost allow you to store produce in breathable container , which considerably lengthen it shelf life . Fewer Solar Panels The SUN FROST RF16 typically consume 15 KWH per month . By contrast , the average refrigerator in a home consume 75 KWH per month . Producing the 75 KWH need to run this refrigerator in an off-grid solar power system would require an initial investment of at least $ 4,500 in hardware . The SUN FROST would require a $ 500 investment . Reliable The cooling system of the Sun Frost refrigerator contain a minimal number of move part . Both the DC and AC compressor incorporate highly reliable , hermetically seal , brushless motor . The efficient thermal design of Sun Frost refrigerator also contribute to their reliability . The top-mounted cooling system run at a low temperature than most , which prolongs the life of the system's lubricant and reduces mechanical strain on the compressor . The cooling system have prove itself to typically provide over twenty-five year of trouble free operation . Cooler Summer Kitchen During the summer , a typical refrigerator add a much heat to your kitchen a a 1000 watt heater run four hour per day ! The energy need by your air conditioner to remove this excess heat will be about half the energy consume by your refrigerator . Increasing the cost of run your refrigerator by an additional 50 % . By producing much less waste heat
