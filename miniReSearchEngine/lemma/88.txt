Brian O'Donovan ( aka BOD ) : Does the clock on my microwave consume more power than the heating element ? ? Brian O'Donovan ( aka BOD ) Sunday , December 4 , 2011 Does the clock on my microwave consume more power than the heating element ? ? According to this article in the Economist `` a typical microwave oven consume more electricity power it digital clock than it do heat food '' . This seem very surprising to me so I decide to test if it be really true by using the individual appliance monitor that I buy from Current Cost Ltd . to monitor the electrical power consume by my own microwave oven at home . When not cook food , my microwave consumes 2 watt of power to power the LED clock . This be actually high than the 1 watt estimate use in the article and would represent a daily usage of about 0.05 Kilowatt-hours . When actively cook food it use about 430 watt , I be surprise how low this be since the microwave be sell a an 800 watt unit and seem to be capable of heating food a fast a expect by receipt write for an 800 watt model . The total daily power consume by the microwave naturally depend upon how much it be use . However , my figure be that the normal usage amount to about 0.15-0.20 Kilowatt-hours per day . This mean that for my microwave , the allegation in the article be not true . However , it be surprise to me that the LED clock be consume 25-30 % of the power of the heating element . Because of this information , I would like to plug out my microwave while not in use . Unfortunately the socket where the microwave get plug in be bury behind a press and it be not very easy to get access to so I will have to do some re-wiring before this be feasible .
