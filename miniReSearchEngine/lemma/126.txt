It be nice be able to program it and operate it remotely , but very annoy when it would cycle off on the really hot day . I do n't know anything about the radiation level , but I 'd be surprise if it be more than that of cell phone , which of course we all hold right next to our head . 08-26-2013 , 05:23 PM cdmoore125 Location : Fed Hill 211 post , read 144,204 time Reputation : 63 Quote : Originally Posted by Kristin730 We move to Delaware in 2011 , but the apartment complex in which we live in Baltimore before that instal them in all the apartment in 2010 .

That be not a smart meter , it be a PeakRewards thermostat . That be control via the same radio frequency that BGE use to communicate to linemen in the area . Technically all radio frequency be radiation .

Not sure if it matter whether I have them instal or not , since I have a row house and my neighbor most likely be get them instal . Regardless , I be concern about the health risk these device may impose . I have a smart meter & I be happy with it . It take 5-10 minute from the tech step in my door to leave . There be a few thing you need to know , and I really encourage you to look at the website to read the detail . 1 . If you do not switch to a smart meter , you will have to pay an opt out fee and then a monthly fee for have someone come out and read your meter each month . 2 . It do emit RF , just a any cell phone or wifi do . If it bother you , you may choose to opt out , but it be costly . Smart meter have be deploy in many part of the country year ago , and the East coast be slow to adopt . You can read up on some of the issue other region have have and make your own choice . Microwaves , walkie-talkie , TVs , and radio station all emit RF . How do you think any signal be transmit ? If you want to avoid any RF , my advice be to avoid any civilization , just because RF be everywhere . What I do think though , the RF emit from the meter would be so short in length that it be safe than sit near a WiFi device for more than a minute . The power of the RF should be pretty small since the meter only need to communicate with one another rather than broadcast a long distance , like a cell phone . 3 . They can save you money in the come year a Smart Energy Manager roll out ( see the BGE website ) . Smart meter will help them establish your baseline usage and then credit you with discount for reduce that on hot day . There be no doubt that smart meter be a hot topic , and they do emit RF . I think you need to present both side of the argument though . Also of note , I be a brain cancer survivor . I still use my cell phone and am around WiFi all day , so I be not overly concern with a little more RF . 08-26-2013 , 06:37 PM DubyaM 146 post , read 133,190 time Reputation : 130 I do n't know if I have a smart meter or not and I would n't have any particular problem if I do . All I know be that the BGE meter reader just drive slowly through the neighborhood seem to get the reading . 08-27-2013 , 12:35 AM kharing 1,905 post , read 1,753,281 time Reputation : 2912 cdmoore125 , thank for the link . I read through it and come across this : In January , the Maryland Public Service Commission ( PSC ) issue an order that Maryland utility should provide customer with an additional option relate to the installation of smart meter in their home . The PSC be still conduct proceeding to determine whether customer can retain their current meter or if utility will have to provide customer with smart meter that operate in an RF-free or near RF-free manner . The PSC will require that customer who select the ultimately approve option pay the appropriate cost . Pay extra to NOT have radiation , really ? I be a bit skeptical of these thing even more now ! Pages - Can I opt out , or choose not to have a meter instal ? 08-27-2013 , 06:16 AM cdmoore125 Location : Fed Hill 211 post , read 144,204 time Reputation : 63 Yes , because with smart meter , your billing can be complete without anyone go to read your meter ; the data be collect via the RF . If you do not have a smart meter , you be one of the few that will be pay the cost of have someone physically come out to your house . While that cost use to be borne by all of your neighbor , now it will only be a few . Further smart meter give the utility an opportunity to shut power off remotely , save cost of send someone out . It can also reduce credit cost for people who do not pay their bill . The amount have not be set , I do not believe . You can follow the PSC for the amount when finalize . 08-27-2013 , 09:59 AM kharing 1,905 post , read 1,753,281 time Reputation : 2912 Quote : Originally Posted by cdmoore125 Yes , because with smart meter , your billing can be complete without anyone go to read your meter ; the data be collect via the RF .

Guess I need to do more research . Still not convince that they pose less health risk than a cell phone . Plus , others report that their bill actually increase after the Smartmeter be instal . It put the consumer at a great disadvantage . Thanks for your input ! 08-27-2013 , 12:08 PM cdmoore125 Location : Fed Hill 211 post , read 144,204 time Reputation : 63 It be quite possible that bill increase ( meter spin slow and incorrectly over time ) , but how can you effectively measure that unless you involve a lot of statistic to tie usage , weather , and number people in your house do the same thing a the year before ? As far a cell phone , see the Huffington Post . `` It be also instructive to compare the radiation level of smart meter with those of other wireless device . Smart meter only transmit data for roughly 1.4 second per day , at very low wattage . And even if one stand less than one meter ( 3 foot ) from a smart meter when it broadcast it data , the result microwave exposure be 550 time less than standing in front of an active microwave oven , and 1100 time less than hold an active cell phone to one 's ear . '' I feel like post from a liberal news source 's blog ( I think liberal be more against smart meter ) should be of some support , but there a ton of article and video out there . 08-28-2013 , 08:41 PM emmiesix 223 post , read 181,408 time Reputation : 230 Quote : Originally Posted by cdmoore125 It be quite possible that bill increase ( meter spin slow and incorrectly over time ) , but how can you effectively measure that unless you involve a lot of statistic to tie usage , weather , and number people in your house do the same thing a the year before ?

This have nothing to do with liberal or conservative . Radiation just mean photon and could be anything from radio wave ( harmless ) to gamma ray . Obviously in this case it be long wavelength and pass harmlessly through your body , just like the radio wave give off by your cell phone , microwave or the wiring in your house . It be not difficult to understand . What frequency be the radiation , and be it absorb by the body . That 's all you need to ask . Critical thinking people , jeez .
