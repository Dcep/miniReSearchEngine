Calculating the energy cost of an appliance or electronic device be fairly easy . Most device have a label that list how many watt it use , either on the device or in the owner 's manual . You will need to find this number to figure out how much the appliance be cost you . You will also need to estimate how many hour a day you use a particular appliance . The Wattage Label If you ca n't find the wattage label , there be other option to determine how much power your device us . For example , you can purchase a wattage measure device , such a the Kill A Watt . Simply plug your appliance or electronic device into the Kill A Watt to determine how much power it use . Or you can contact the manufacturer , with your model number , to find out how many watt a particular device consume . You can also check the list at the bottom of the page for common wattage on household device . Though your particular device may vary , it should give you a rough estimate of the energy expense relate to the device . Calculate Electricity Consumption - 4 Easy Steps Step 01 Watts Per Day To calculate energy consumption cost , simply multiply the unit 's wattage by the number of hour you use it to find the number of watt-hour consume each day . For example , let 's say you use a 125 watt television for three hour per day . By multiplying the wattage by the number of hour use per day , we find that you be use 375 watt-hour per day . 125 watt X 3 hour = 375 watt-hour per day Step 02 Convert to Kilowatts But electricity be measure in kilowatt hour on your electricity bill . Since we know that 1 kilowatt be equal to 1,000 watt , calculate how many kWh a particular device us be as easy a dividing by 1,000 . 375 watt-hour per day / 1000 = 0.375 kWh per day Step 03 Usage Over a Month Period Now to find out how much that 's actually go to cost you on your electric bill , you 'll have to take the equation a bit far . First you 'll need to figure out how many kWh the TV use per month . 375 watt-hour per day X 30 day = 11.25 kWh per month Step 04 Figuring Out the Cost Next , pull out your last electric bill and see how much you pay per kWh . For this example , let 's say you pay 10 cent per kilowatt hour . To find how much the TV be cost you in a month , multiply your electricity rate by the kWh per month that you calculate above . 11.25 kWh per month X $ 0.10 per kWh = $ 1.13 per month Another Example Here 's another more costly example : Your refrigerator run 24 hour a day . Most refrigerator consume 300-780 watt of electricity . Let 's assume you buy a model that use only 300 watt . 300 watt X 24 hour = 7,200 watt-hour per day 7,200 watt-hour per day / 1000 = 7.2 kWh per day 7.2 kWh per day X 30 day = 216 kWh per month 216 kWh per month x $ 0.10 per kWh = $ 21.60 per month Common Wattages for Household Appliances The wattage on appliance or electronics varies by device . Typically , old model appliance use more energy , but new model tend to be more efficient . You can also purchase ENERGY STAR appliance , which be among the most efficient appliance . According to the EPA , here 's a list of typical wattage level for your everyday device . Coffee maker 900-1200 watt Microwave 750-1100 watt Toaster 800-1400 watt Dishwasher 1200-2400 watt Washer 350-500 watt Dryer 1800-5000 watt Iron 100-1800 watt Ceiling fan 65-175 watt Space heater ( 40gal ) 4500-5500 watt Hair dryer 1200-1875 watt Laptop 50 watt Computer monitor 150 watt Computer tower 120 watt Television 19 '' -36 '' 65-133 watt Television 53 '' -61 '' 170 watt Looking to upgrade to energy-efficient appliance ?
