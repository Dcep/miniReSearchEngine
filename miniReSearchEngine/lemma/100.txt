See how this be calculate and how to misquote this website How much electricity do my refrigerator use ? Last update : April , 2014 Refrigerators be a big chunk of home energy use In most home the refrigerator be the second-largest user of electricity ( 13.7 % ) , right after the air conditioner ( 14.1 % ) . ( Dept . of Energy ) With most appliance you save energy by use them less , but you ca n't very well do that with your fridge . The main way to save money with your fridge be to use an efficient model . New fridge be n't just a little more efficient , they're incredibly more efficient . A 1986-era 18 c.f . fridge us 1400 kWh a year , while a modern energy-efficient model us only 350 kWh a whopping 75 % reduction . At 15 kWh , trading in a pre-1986 fridge for a new efficient one would save about $ 158 a year in electricity cost . And some older fridge be even bad than the average . One reader estimate her saving to be $ 238 per year for trading in her 1979 fridge for a 2004 model . One big caveat : All the figure on this page be with any ice maker turn OFF . When the icemaker be on then usage could be as much a double . ( Consumer Reports , 2008 ) If you trade in an old fridge without an icemaker for an icemaker-equipped fridge , and you run the icemaker , you might not see any saving . Should you replace your current fridge ? If your fridge be make before 2001 , then yes , you should almost certainly trade it in . Older fridge be wildly ineffecient . The best modern model use less than half of what 1993-2000 fridge use . For old fridge it 's even more strike : Replacing a 1992 fridge with a modern Energy Star model could save $ 1400 in electricity cost over the useful life of the fridge . So if you 've get an old fridge , yes , trade it in . You might even be able to get a state rebate for buying an energy-efficient fridge . Your city or utility might have a rebate program , too . ( Check with them . ) Sample saving for replace an old 22 c.f . fridge with a new model A 22 cf fridge make in this year ... Uses about this much energy ... Replacing with a 2001+ model save : Replacing with a 2008+ Energy Star model save : Replacing with a CEE Tier 3 model save : < 1976 2200 kWh $ 238 / yr . $ 257 / yr . $ 266 / yr . 1976-86 1700 kWh $ 165 / yr . $ 183 / yr . $ 192 / yr . 1987-89 1150 kWh $ 83 / yr . $ 101 / yr . $ 110 / yr . 1990-92 1100 kWh $ 73 / yr . $ 92 / yr . $ 101 / yr . 1993-00 850 kWh 37 / yr . $ 55 / yr . $ 64 / yr . 2001-2010 600 kWh - $ 18 / yr . $ 28 / yr . 2001-2004 Energy Star ( 10 % + good ) 550 kWh - $ 9 / yr . $ 18 / yr . 2004-2008 Energy Star ( 15 % + good ) 525 kWh - $ 5 / yr . $ 14 / yr . 2008-2010 Energy Star ( 20 % + good ) 500 kWh - - $ 9 / yr . CEE Tier 3 ( 30 % +better ) 425 kWh - - - Bold row be current model . Assumes electricity rate of $ 0.15 per kWh and icemaker OFF . See how this be calculate and how to misquote this website . If your fridge be make 2001 or late , it 's a tougher call . As you can see from the table , trading in a 2001+ model for a new Energy Star model might save around $ 20/yr . in energy cost , or $ 280 over it useful life . That's certainly not a much a it would cost you to buy a new fridge . On the other hand , you 're go to have to replace your fridge sooner or late anyway , since the average useful life be only around 14 year . So the question be n't really , `` Should I replace my fridge ? `` , but rather , `` Should I replace it early ( before it need replace ) ? '' To answer that question , use the calculator above , not the table , because the calculator will let you choose your fridge size and local electricity rate , which be all-important . As I always say , the figure provide in the table be sample . Your saving will differ depend on how much you 're pay for electricity and the size of the fridge . ( It 'll also differ by the exact model you buy , and how warm or cool your kitchen be , by the way . ) One reason to replace the fridge now be that save energy reduces pollution . I always pay a little more if it mean I pollute a little less . I trade in my old fridge before it die for that very reason . Help in choosing a new fridge Get an EnergyStar model . In the U.S. , look for the Energy Star label , which identifies fridges that be at least 20 % more efficient than standard model . ( EPA ; see Sources for old standard ) ( Don't confuse this with the EnergyGuide label that all appliance get . ) At 15/kWh , a 25 c.f . EnergyStar fridge will save about an extra $ 23/year vs. standard model , or $ 322 over it life . That will more than pay for the extra cost of an Energy Star model , which be only $ 38 for a ~22 cu.ft . model on Sears.com today ( 6/1/10 ) . CEE Tier 3 . While Energy Star fridge use 20 % less energy than standard model , CEE Tier 3 ( CT3 ) fridge use 30 % less . ( source , PDF ) That 's great for those who want to be as efficient a possible , but at 15/kWh , that extra 10 % amount to only $ 9/year saving over an Energy Star fridge . That 's because Energy Star fridge be already very efficient . The $ 9/year work out to $ 126 over the fridge 's useful life , which be almost exactly the $ 120 extra that the CT3 model cost ( accord my price check in 6/10 on Sears.com ) . So it might not save you any money , but since the saving can pay for itself , it do n't hurt to go with a CT3 model . And of course , if your local electric rate be high than I use in my example , you 'll actually see more saving . The only problem in shopping for a CT3 fridge be that they 're usually not label a CT3 . You 'll have to download the CT3 fridge list for reference when you go shop For a small fridge ( 18-22cf ) , get a Top-Freezer model . Refrigerators with the freezer on top use the least energy . Side-by-Side model use 13 % more juice than top-freezer model , accord to my analysis of the Energy Star fridge list from May 2010 . However , a of 2007 , top freezer model aren't available in large size ( > 22cf ) , so a top-freezer be an option only if you 're go with a small unit . Almost all the big fridge be make these day be side-by-side . ( EPA , 194k PDF ) ( Interestingly , bottom-freezer model be about the same efficiency a top-freezers , even though you 'd suspect that bottom-freezer model would have an advantage since hot air rise . Also , the penalty for side-by-side model use to be even high . An August 2002 Consumer Reports article show that 2002-era side-by-side model use a whopping 45 % more energy than top-freezer model . ) Skip the ice maker and dispenser . These ratchet up the energy use quite a bit . According to the EPA these feature mean 14-20 % in extra energy , but Consumer Reports testing show that these feature could double energy use . ( EPA , Consumer Reports ) Super-Efficient Fridges . Sun Frost make super-efficient fridge , include a 16 cubic foot model that use only 372 kWh a year . ( They 're market towards people who be power their home with solar electricity , where every watt count . ) A new Japanese model call CoolView claim to reduce cost by up to 55 % . Also , you can make your own super-efficient fridge by converting a chest freezer . It use a mere 0.1 kWh a day , or 36.5 kWh a year ! Chest freezer be more efficient than fridge because they have more insulation and because the cold air do n't spill out when you open the door , because cold air fall down , not up . There be a couple of obvious downside . First be that it might not be as easy for you to access your food in a chest freezer . Another be that the new fridge will take up more floor space . Finally , you 'll need a separate freezer . But if these thing do n't put you off , then you can save quite a bit of energy . Read Tom 's instruction for how to make a super-efficient fridge . Old manual defrost fridge wo n't save money . You might have hear that manual defrost fridge use less energy than frost-free , so you might be tempt to look for an old manual defrost model . Do n't . Old fridge use way more energy than new one , even if the old one be manual defrost . I once have an old manual-defrost model that use 1000 kWh year , which be more than twice what a modern 425 kWh Energy Star , frost-free model us . Now , a modern manual-defrost fridge could be an energy-saver , but I have n't be able to find one that 's energy efficient . The only modern frost-free model I know of be the Vestfrost , but it use 548 kWh more than a standard fridge . Saving energy with your exist fridge Turn off the anti-sweat feature . Many fridge have small heater that keep moisture from form on the cabinet . This use an extra 5-10 % extra electricity . Most model that have this feature have a switch that let you turn it off , usually label `` Energy Saver '' . ( source ) Set the temperature for only a cold a you need it . Fridge should be 36-40F , and the freezer should be 0-5F ( -17 to -10C ) . Fridges set 10 degree low than need ( or freezer set 5 degree low than need ) can increase energy use by as much a 20-25 % . Personally , I set my own fridge to 56 because a a vegan I never store super-perishables like meat or dairy . To test the fridge temperature , put a thermometer in a glass of water in the center of the fridge and leave it there for 24 hour . To test the freezer temperature , put the thermometer between two freeze package . If the temperature be cold than need , then set the fridge to a warmer temperature . Do n't put hot food in the fridge . Food safety expert say you should refrigerate hot food to prevent contamination . But that do n't mean you have to refrigerate them immediately . The USDA say to refrigerate within two hour of preparation ( or one hour if the room temp be above 90 ) . One to two hour of cool off time will definitely make your refrigerator work less . It 's a tradeoff -- the sooner you refrigerate the safer the food , but the more energy you 'll use . Of course , meat and dairy food be most susceptible to contamination , which be yet another reason to not eat meat and dairy in the first place . Yosh Hash sent in the tip that you can greatly cool item by put them in a container and soak them in a pot of cold water for 15-30 minute , which reduces the amount of heat the fridge will have to remove once you stick them in the fridge . Along the same line , he write : `` A lot of people do not seem to understand that the middle position on a faucet mean half cold , half hot . I've seen people fill a pitcher with lukewarm water and put it in the fridge ! What a waste -- they pay to heat the water , then they pay to take that heat right back out of the water . Please tell your reader when when they 're refrigerate water , they should draw cold water into the pitcher , not warm . '' Consider your wish grant . Thaw freeze food in the fridge rather than on the counter . They 'll help cool the fridge a they defrost . Pick a good spot for the fridge . Your fridge will use less energy if you keep it away from heat and also place it where the heat it generate can easily dissipate . Position your fridge out of direct sunlight , and away from heat source such a the oven and heat register . Help the fridge get rid of the heat it generate by placing it along an external wall . If you do n't use air condition then put the fridge in front of an open window to let the heat easily escape . This do n't just make your fridge work less , it keep your house cooler too . If your choice for locate your fridge be limit then at the very least make sure there a at least 2 '' of space all around to allow for circulation . More on temperature & energy use : A Sun Frost fridge use 61 % more energy in a 90-degree F environment than a 70-degree environment . Home Energy magazine have a chart show refrigerator energy use per degree of temperature . But this do n't mean you should keep your house extra cool so that the fridge use less energy , because you 'll use way more energy to cool your home than you 'll save be have your fridge work less . Air conditioning use way more electricity than fridge . Instead , just put your fridge in a good location , a explain above . Door Openings . Home Energy magazine say door opening account for 7 % of fridge energy use , assume 42 door opening a day . But the Institute of Food & Agricultural Sciences at the University of Florida ( link no long available ) say poor open/close habit waste 50 to 120kWh a year , which would be 10-24 % of a 500 kWh/yr . fridge . They do n't say whether this be too-frequent open , or leave open too long when open , or both . I'm openly call on reader to test how much door-openings matter , use a Kill-A-Watt meter , keep track of how many time and for how long you open the door , compare to a 24- or 48-hour period where you do n't open the door at all . Report your finding and I 'll share them with everyone on this page . Defrost a non-frost-free freezer before the frost exceed a quarter-inch thick . More frost make the freezer work harder . But good yet , if your fridge be n't frost-free , that mean it 's old , and old fridge use ton of energy . Replace it with a new model , make in 2001 or late . Cleaning the coil help a little , but not much . Just about every other Saving Energy guide out there tell you that clean the coil on your fridge be important to saving energy . They're guessing . Cleaning a set of very dirty coil will save maybe 5 % , or less than $ 5 a year on a post-2000 era fridge . ( source ) One reader , Steve , measure the energy use of his old 1995 , 24 c.f . fridge for about 100 hour each before and after clean the coil . He get a 6.5 % reduction in energy , which will save him $ 8.30 a year at 15/kWh . Of course , it can't hurt to clean them , so here 's how to clean the coil : The coil be the small , wind black pipe either on the back of the fridge , or the slotted vent on the bottom . If you can reach the coil easily with a brush and/or vacuum then use that . If they 're hard to get to , then you can do what Steve do and move the fridge to the yard and then blast the coil with a leaf blower . Use a transparent plastic curtain You may have see these in the perishable section of a grocery store -- vertical transparent plastic strip . They keep the cold in while still allow you to see what 's behind them . You can do the same thing for your fridge by cutting up a transparent plastic shower curtain and tap it to the ceiling of the fridge compartment . If you do this , I recommend one of the new EVA curtain ( such a this one form Bed Bath & Beyond ) , rather than the more common PVC curtain , which be smelly and much more toxic and definitely something you don't want around food . Make sure the gasket be in good shape . The gasket be that piece of rubber go around the door that seal the door to the refrigerator . If it do n't seal well , then cold air be escape so your fridge be work a lot harder . If part of it be come off , then re-attach it with some adhesive caulk . Turn the fridge OFF ? ! Elizabeth Stone write : `` I be inspire this month to unplug my refrigerator and cool just with ice that I can make outdoors . I can keep the refrigerator at 45 degree for about five day with a couple of big pot full of ice . It have occur to me how wasteful it be to be cool something in the winter in a northern climate ! It take more attention and effort than just have a plugged-in refrigerator , but perhaps there be others out there that might also try this if they be give the idea . '' At first I think this be a good idea , but it actually do n't work , because while your fridge work a little less by importing ice , your heater have to work a little more . Here 's how that work : There 's X amount of heat in your home in the winter . As heat slowly escape your home through wall and windows , your heater kick in and heat the house up again . Now you bring in a big block of ice . No matter where you put it , that effectively extract heat from your home , since the ice will absorb it . Granted , it will take longer for that to happen when the ice be in the seal fridge rather than on your living room floor , but it 'll still happen over time , and that brings u to the next point : Before you put extra ice in the fridge , the exhaust from the fridge be help to heat the house , so your heater could run a little less . But once you add the ice to the fridge and turn it off , the fridge be no longer help with the house heat . So you save on the energy to run the fridge , but you use a little more energy to heat the house . Yes , it 's not much more energy to heat the house , but neither be it much energy save in the fridge with the ice , either . In theory there 's some financial saving if your local rate for electricity for the fridge be a lot higher than your local rate for whatever fuel you use to heat the house with , but even in that case the saving would be so small a to be negligible . One reader ask if you could just make ice with the icemaker to cool the fridge ? You could , but it wo n't save any energy , because it take energy to make the ice with the icemaker . Now , keep some ice in the fridge can also help keep your food cool if the power go out , but it 's not an energy-saving technique . Data on old fridge . One company compile a massive database of energy use for 41,000 different refrigerator model from 1979 to 1992 . I have a separate page about question I 've receive and answer about refrigerator , a well a my source and technical data .
