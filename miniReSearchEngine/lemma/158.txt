Small Steps for Sustainability : Back to Basics : Boiling the Kettle Small Steps for Sustainability One household attempt to tread more gently 19 October 2013 Back to Basics : Boiling the Kettle How much energy do it take to boil the kettle ? Is it more than I need to use ? Some time ago I realise that I almost always overfill the kettle , and I have be work at reduce how much water I put in . It take a while to get the hang of it , but I can now say we be commit to putting in only a much water a we intend to use . As my mum and dad be visit from Victoria for a couple of week , our kettle be work extra hard and it seem timely to publish this commitment . This be a simple post about a simple action in tune with our original intention to take up one additional act towards sustainable living per month . Initial Time : zero - but it do take many month to change old habit . Like my habit of filling and boil the kettle half an hour before guest arrive , so they would n't have to wait so long for their cuppa . This then require reboiling the kettle when they arrive and often I have more hot water than I need because I do n't know in advance how many cuppa I would be make . I ca n't think of a guest to our house who would mind wait a few extra minute for their hot drink . Or the practice of someone in this house ( who shall remain un-named ) of boil the kettle then an hour late remembering the cuppa have not be make so reboiling the kettle ... and perhaps remember this or the next time to actually do something with the water ... Initial Cost : zero - a cost save ( see below ) Ongoing time or cost commitment : zero Impact : When I fill our kettle I be generally boil around 1.25L more water than I need . It take 430.5kJ to heat 1.25kg of water from 18 C ( ambient temperature ) to 100 C ( boil ) . This be equivalent of approximately 120Wh . To put that in perspective , every time I boil a full kettle to make one or two cuppa , the excess energy I be use be equivalent to leave two sixty Watt light globes on for an hour , or to have our energy-saver 20 Watt kitchen light on for six hour . If I boil the kettle full four time a day , in a year I would have use 174.5 kWh of electricity do nothing at all - boil water I do n't need . Our Perth electricity company currently charge 26 cent per kWh ( unit ) and we have opt for a natural power premium of an extra 5 cent per unit . This mean our commitment to only boil the water we need be save u $ 54 per year ( plus GST - total close to $ 60 ) . [ for those interested in formula : change in temperature ( T ) x mass ( M ) x heat capacity of water ( C ) , where T =82 C M=1.25kg C=4.2kJ/kg C = 430.5kJ 1 kWh = 3.6MJ 0.4305 / 3.6 = 0.1195kWh = 120Wh 0.1195kWh x 4 boil per day x 365 day = 174.47 kWh ] Thanks Tyson for know the formula ... I 'll have a cuppa next time you 're boil ...
