Whilst I have a rough idea of how much a kettle use , I think I would test my own kettle at home to see how much it use , and how much time and energy be waste by boiling more water than you need . I have previously discuss how much energy we waste a a nation by boiling more water than we need in Energy Saving Tip - Boiling the Kettle . I test the Russell Hobbs Satin Montana Kettle ( Model No . 14150 ) , rat a a 3kW kettle , after approximately 6 second the kettle begin to draw power and use between 2.81kW and 2.87kW . However if you boil a full kettle ( 1.75lt ) , the kettle take 212.8 second to boil . If you be use the kettle for a single cup of tea you could have save 173.3 second , a boiling a single cup ( allow approximately 10 % more for evaporation ) take a mere 40.5 second . Boiling a full kettle require 0.16kWh ( about 2 penny ) whereas a single cup , require only 0.03kWh ( about 0.4 penny ) . If you be a mad tea drinker then boil what you need a oppose to what you do n't need could save you a bit over the year , not to mention alot of time . So what can you do to reduce your impact ; The Eco Kettle The innovative Eco Kettle have a unique double chamber that get you to measure out exactly how much water you want to boil , save electricity , water , money and time , make it good for the planet ... and you still get to have a great cup of tea . That 's smart think - make the eco kettle one of our favourite eco product , and an essential for any eco friendly kitchen or workplace . Using a kettle to boil more water than you need be the equivalent to powering 300 CFLs unnecessarily . Referring to the measure on the side can help you to accurately determine the amount of liquid necessary Measure how much water you require by filling the cup or saucepan you be plan to use and then pour this water into the kettle , remember to add a little bit extra to compensate for evaporation For information on the electricity consumption of other product check out `` How Much Electricity Does a ...
