Your situation might be different depending upon local and current price , though . To do an accurate comparison , you 'll need to check your bill to find the rate for electric and gas that you 're pay to your particular provider . There 's no way around this ; you ca n't get meaningful result if you skip that step . Also , if you do n't already have gas service , then sign up for it mean that you 'll pay ~ $ 12/mo . or so to the gas company for the privilege of be their customer . You 're also look at the cost of have the gas line run if your home do n't already have them . These thing can quickly erase the saving of gas appliance over electric in many to most situation . While gas be generally cheap , it do have a couple of downside . With gas your house be more likely to explode . And the byproduct of gas combustion from oven and heating be unhealthy to breathe , and can actually kill pet bird . For these reason , I use electric instead of gas in my own home . Of course , my energy use be so small that the extra cost of electricity be minimal for me . Likewise , I hope to help my reader reduce their energy consumption so that the difference between electric and gas cost for them be insignificant .

I don't endorse the advertiser . Some assumption : 106F hot , 88F warm , regulate by washer . Washers be U.S. style ( w/both hot & cold supply line ) . See other assumption & source . Electric vs. gas ovens/stoves See the calculator above . More info be available in full report on energy use by cooking . Electric vs. gas clothe dryer See the calculator at right . More info be available in my full report on energy use by clothes dryer . Electric vs. gas heat I do n't have comparison table for electric vs. gas heat specifically yet , but I do have quite a bit of info about save energy on heating . Chart from DoE . Divide price by 10 to get price per therm or per CCF . Cost of Natural Gas Natural gas price be all over the map , literaly . First of all , price vary greatly by region . The price in Florida be double the price in California . Prices have also jump wildly in short period of time . The average U.S. price double from 2005 to 2008 , and then fell by half from 2008 to 2011 . ( The chart at right show price for the last few decade . ) Still , even when gas price be at their high , it 's generally cheap to run appliance on natural gas instead of electricity . The national average price of residential gas be $ 1.29/Ccf in 2014 . ( source ) ( Ccf and therm be roughly the same , more on this late . ) But average price be useless for calculate your own cost and saving potential since cost vary widely by area and because they can change quickly . That go for state-by-state average too , because the price from your own provider likely differs at least somewhat from the state average . ( price by state ) On this site I have to use something for calculation and default , so I often use $ 1.30/therm or Ccf , which be close to the 2014 average . Natural gas be measure in Ccf or therm . For calculation purpose , they 're essentially the same ( 1 ccf = 1 therm ) . There 's no direct conversion because ccf measure the volume of gas , while therm measure the energy in the gas , and the amount of energy varies by the quality of gas . It 's like try to state how many calorie be in a loaf of breadit depends on the bread . In the U.S. in 2013 , the average be 1 therm = 1.025 ccf . ( source ) That 's so close that for most purpose , therm and ccf be essentially interchangeable . Based on the above : Ccf = hundred cubic foot . The `` C '' be roman for one hundred . Ccf 1.025 = therm . Mcf = thousand cubic foot . The `` M '' be roman for one thousand , not an abbreviation for million . Mcf 10 = Ccf . Mcf 10.25 = therm . Therm = 100,000 Btu . therm x 1.025 = ccf . therm 100,000 = Btu . Btu = British thermal unit . Btus x 100,000 = therm . Some gas bill measure the gas in cubic meter instead of therm . One therm be 2.75 cubic meter , and 1 cubic meter be 0.36 therm . Cost of Electricity The average cost of residential electricity be 13/kWh in the U.S. in 2014 , though a I explain elsewhere , average rate be all but useless for figuring how much you pay for electricity . The average U.S. household use 909 kWh/mo . in 2013 and would pay $ 118.17 for it at the 13/kWh average rate . ( Dept . of Energy ) Like gas , the cost of electricity varies by location . Do n't assume the state rate be accurate for you , because rate vary even within a state . I have more info about electric cost on our cost of electricity page . Appliance Therms kWh per hour Furnace pilot light 7.3/mo . n/a Water Heater pilot light 3.3-4.2/mo . n/a Range pilot light 2.6/mo . n/a Range burner , small 0.05/hr . 0.6 Range burner , large 0.09/hr . 1.0 Oven 0.25/hr . 2.0 Clothes Dryer 0.19-0.35/hr . 5.0 Furnace & water heater pilot from Murphy and from the discussion on this page . Others from : Wisconsin Public Service , Okaloosa Gas , Sears catalog , and my laundry calculation page . 1 therm = 100,000 BTU = 1.023 Ccf Comparing the operating cost of electric vs. gas appliance Above I provide calculator for compare the cost of gas and electric appliance . For those who prefer to crunch the number themselves , here 's what you 'll need to know : The price of electricity in kWh . The amount of electricity use in kWh . The price of gas in therm . The amount of gas use in therm . # 1 and # 3 be easy to find , just look at your bill . For electricity , make sure you add all the kWh cost for electricity , since some utility company have separate charge for delivery and fuel . ( More on electrical charge . ) # 2 be also pretty easy , use the table and method describe on this site . For starter , here 's our page of electricity use by typical appliance , and how to measure electrical use . # 4 be usually the hard , because the amount of gas use by appliance for a give task or amount of time be usually not so easy to find . But I 'll make it easy by listing those figure for you now , and throw in the electric version for comparison , in the table at right . Gas use by the pilot light The gas use by pilot light be substantial . At $ 1.40/therm , you 're look at $ 183/yr . to run the pilot in a furnace and a water heater , not even count a stove . Pilots could easily account for over 70 % of summer gas usage , and 40 % of total usage . ( Murphy ) If your furnace have a pilot , turn it off during the non-heating month . ( You ca n't just blow it out , because gas will still flow , and soon your house will blow up . ) For your stove , turn off the burner pilot and use a click-lighter to light them . And the next time you replace your appliance , get the one that have electric ignition . In the winter , the energy from the pilot light be n't waste since it add heat to your home . But when you 're not run a heater , then pilot light be 100 % wasteful . While Murphy's pilot light article give 3.3 therms/mo . for a water heater pilot light , his water heating page suggest 4.2 therm , a follows : 510 Btu per meter revolution , with ten revolution in 11.2 hour . That 's one revolution every 1011.2 = 0.893h . At 30.4375 day in a month time 24 hours/d , that 's 730.5 h/mo . So 730.5 h/mo . 0.893 h/rev = 818 revs/mo . That 's 818 revs./mo . x 510 Btu/rev = 417,180 Btu/mo.. At 1 therm = 100,000 BTU , 417,180 Btu 100,000 = 4.17 therm .
