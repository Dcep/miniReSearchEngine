Rapid City Journal May 17 , 2013 4:00 am By Joel Welin Joel Welin joel.welin @ rapidcityjournal.com ( 0 ) Comments Dear Jim : I be try to run my central air conditioner less to save electricity . Would use a portable air conditioner use less electricity ? Does one have to be vent outdoors through a window ? - Karlene M . Dear Karlene : Anytime you exchange the use of an energy-intensive large central air conditioner with a cooling appliance which us less amperage , you reduce your electric bill . These cool appliance include window and portable air conditioner , whole-house fan , ceiling fan , etc . The latter two option , both fan , use the least amount of electricity , but they technically do not cool the air . A ceiling fan just make you feel cool by creating a breeze in the room . A whole-house fan do bring in cooler outdoor air , typically at night , but high humidity may be a problem . Depending upon it size ( cool capacity in Btuh ) , use a portable air conditioner may use just one-eighth a much electricity a your central air conditioner . Keep in mind though , it will cool only one room or one area ( call zone cooling ) , so your entire house will not be as cool . This zone cool can be an effective energy-saver though . Depending upon the activity you be do in various room , you may not have to keep them all extremely cool . Sometimes running just a ceiling fan may create adequate comfort . For example , there be no need to keep the entire house cool at night when you can run a portable air conditioner in your bedroom . A portable air conditioner do have to be vent outdoors through a window to provide cooling . Window adapter be include with all the model . These be typically design to fit into vertical or horizontal slider windows , but you should be able to rig up an adapter for casement windows . If you be do a particularly energetic activity and just want to have cool air blowing directly on you , a portable air conditioner can be use unvented . Even though the air feel cool blow on your skin , the room you be in be actually be heat overall by use it in this fashion . Rather thanbuyinga portable air conditioner , consider a heat pump model . It be not a lot more expensive and you can use it for zone heating during winter to also reduce your heating bill . Even if you have inexpensive natural gas heat , zone heating this way may still save overall . You will have the option of select a one- or two-duct model . Two-duct model be generally more efficient because no room air be be lose outdoors . With a one-duct model , indoor air be be draw through the condenser coil for cool and exhaust outdoors . If high humidity be a problem in your area , select a model with a dehumidification mode for comfort .

Dear Jim : We try to keep our house a airtight a possible . We recently have new plumbing instal and there be some hole in the wall under the kitchen sink . Should we be concern about seal these ? - Bob R . Dear Bob : If the hole be on an inside wall , from an energy efficiency standpoint , there probably be no need to seal them . On a windy day , hold your hand under the sink near the hole to check for draft to be sure . You may still want to seal the hole to keep insect and mouse from get under the sink . They be draw to moisture and food particle . Shoot a bead of caulk around piece of scrap drywall and stick them over the hole .
