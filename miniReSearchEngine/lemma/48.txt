Victoria Worden of Bel Air call to say she think her August BGE bill be too high . Late last month BGE meter reader be help restore power , with the result that BGE could n't read about 170,000 meter -- include Worden 's . Instead BGE sent out estimate bill . In 2010 Worden 's August bill be in the $ 50 range , she say . This year , after BGE estimate it , the August bill be way high -- $ 75.50 , she say . And the average temperature for this August be a degree cooler than last year , accord to BGE . `` $ 75 be way out of line , '' Worden say . She 's not even sure she run the AC last month , and she expect the bill to be much low . Certainly low than the bill from this July , which be really really hot . Especially since , after Hurricane Irene , she say she do n't have any electricity during part of August for almost 40 hour ! But her bill be about the same for both July and August . UPDATE , 11 a.m. : BGE put out a press release on this this morning , say : `` Baltimore Gas and Electric Company ( BGE ) today announce that a a result of Hurricane Irene , meter reader be assign to storm duty and do not read any gas or electric meter from Aug. 30 Sept. 1 . On August 29 and Sept. 2 , some , but not all meter be read . '' BGE be say 150,000 household be `` affect , '' but the total number of home with unread meter be 170,000 , include those on budget billing . BGE 's full press release be below the fold . If your bill seem too high for August and it 's a hassle , do what Worden do and call BGE at 410-685-0123 . She say they agree to bill her zero for August and then put everything on the September bill once they read the meter . ( If your estimate bill prof to be too high , BGE be suppose to credit the overbilled amount the next time the meter be read . ) I have a similar experience . My July 2011 bill be $ 277 , and I figure August would be way low . But it be n't . BGE estimate that I owe $ 252 for last month . My average daily kilowatt use in August , accord to BGE 's estimate , be 25 percent more than it be in August 2010 -- even though , a mention , this year 's August be cool than last year 's . ( I do n't lose power after the hurricane , however . ) I ask BGE for a response to all customer who may believe they be overbilled . ( BGE do n't give me any special treatment , and I do n't ask them to change my bill . ) BGE have software that estimate bill when meter reader ca n't get out , say Jeannette Mills , the utility 's senior vice president for customer relation . The estimate be base on actual , meter usage of similar customer , BGE say . Sometimes it overestimate . Sometimes it underestimate , Mills say . But it do n't make allowance for when your power go out . So there be probably other folk out there like Worden , with overestimated bill . Mills deny that this give a big boost to BGE 's cash flow . `` There be no windfall , '' she say . `` There be no significant positive cash flow increase . '' BGE spokesman Rob Gould say that eliminate estimate bill will be one of the benefit of smart meter , due to be instal start next year . They 'll beam your kilowatt use straight to headquarters every day . If you 're on budget billing , where BGE smooth out seasonal variation to make your invoice more or less the same every month , your bill probably be n't significantly alter by an unread meter last month , BGE say . Read BGE 's full press release below : Baltimore Gas and Electric Company Customers May Receive Estimated Bills Due to Hurricane Irene Meter reader assign to storm duty for several day during and follow hurricane Approximately 150,000 customer will receive estimate bill due to hurricane BALTIMORE , Sept. 14 , 2011 Baltimore Gas and Electric Company ( BGE ) today announce that a a result of Hurricane Irene , meter reader be assign to storm duty and do not read any gas or electric meter from Aug. 30 Sept. 1 .

Hurricane Irene be one of the big storm in BGEs 200-year history and it force u to suspend normal business operation for several day in order to focus our attention on restoring electric service to our customer a safely and a quickly a possible , say Jeannette M. Mills , senior vice president and chief customer officer for BGE . During large-scale storm restoration event such a Hurricane Irene , meter reader like the majority of BGEs 3,000 employee have storm assignment that be different from their normal day-to-day job . BGEs meter reader be dispatch to address public safety concern during and in the hour and immediate day follow Hurricane Irene . Many of them respond to report of down wire and sit in vehicle near downed wire to ensure the safety of others until a crew could respond and de-energize the wire or restore service .

If this BGE/Constellation 's way of make up for the cost of storm repair ? They always have an angle . What be the definition of public utility ? Posted by : Baltihon | September 14 , 2011 7:44 AM I suggest we pay them what we estimate their service to be worth . My power go out shortly after midnight on Thursday . They begin fix it around 6:00 that even . Well after the 11:00 AM estimate to have it restore . Posted by : DOOM161 | September 14 , 2011 7:45 AM Maybe BGE can take the overcharge and invest them in upgrading their crumbling infrastructure ... not likely . Perhaps the PSC should fine BGE for each outage with part of it go to the people to help those chronically out purchase a generator . Posted by : dirth vader | September 14 , 2011 7:45 AM From what I have read , the SMART METERS will CHARGE YOU MORE MONEY for the kilowatt you use during Peak Hours . How it work ... when you get your whopping bill , you reduce the amount of electricity you use during peak hour . This unfairly impact vulnerable population . I know my eighty year old parent and some citizen with health and money concern will turn of their electricity/AC/Heat to save money . Stop the Smart Meters ! Posted by : Baltihon | September 14 , 2011 7:51 AM Yea , my bill be $ 200 for July . August when it be much cool and we do n't have power our bill be $ 250 . A $ 50 dollar increase ? They estimate our usage at 48 Kwh per day even though our usage in June/July be 29 and 36 respectively . They good reimburse u at the charged rate for the electricity . Posted by : Ryan K | September 14 , 2011 7:56 AM This be only the tip of the iceberg . My parent typical monthly bill during the winter be usually at maximum $ 150 per month . However , when they could n't get a reading from the second meter which they instal . They start their so call estimate billing . For roughly 3.5 - 4 month . They be send a bill for $ 2000 . Even when I try to reason with them about the average per month usage of $ 150 during the winter month for the past year . They refuse to listen to logic . They say that their people could n't read the meter so estimate bill be use . It take close to a dozen phonecalls , 3 week , and have people come out in order to straighten out the issue . The second meter be n't even on and turn out it never even have electricty pas through it . We do n't even get an apology . The government need to investigate this and see how rampant their billing abuse be . Posted by : Tae Chung | September 14 , 2011 8:14 AM My August estimate bill be also very similar to my July bill and high than last year . The estimate should be your last year usage plus or minus a percentage base on the average temperture difference . PSC should audit BGE 's cash flow for August . Of course with customer not have power they should have much less cash than LY . Posted by : Dennis from Catonsville | September 14 , 2011 8:29 AM BGE ALWAYS over charge for estimate bill . They may make up the difference the follow month , but for that one month they have accumulate a huge amount of money in overcharge that they either invest or make interest on . Then they refund back only the principle . A quick way to make customer basically give BGE a free interest free loan where they get to keep the interest . Pretty slick ! Posted by : afmcalax | September 14 , 2011 8:39 AM Is an extra $ 25 really go to break Ms. Worden 's bank ? If it truly be a hardship , she should think of it a a force saving plan . It 's not like BGE be just take the money . Her bill next month will be much small and easy to pay . Is it the interest she 's worry about ? I 'll be generous and use 1 % APR ( find only at internet bank these day ) compound monthly for one month . That come to about 2 cent . There be big problem in the world , move along people . Posted by : Jimbo | September 14 , 2011 9:03 AM $ 75 ? My average monthly bill be around $ 300 . Does this woman live in a tiny house ? Or am I get overcharged ? Posted by : Cats McGee | September 14 , 2011 9:32 AM Jimbo ... youre an idiot . Posted by : logic | September 14 , 2011 10:07 AM @ Cats McGee - I be think the same thing ! I 'd be the happy camper in town if I receive a bill that be $ 75 instead of the $ 350 I be charge for August . The only thing worse than summer BGE bill be the $ 500+ bill I get in the winter . Posted by : Jan | September 14 , 2011 10:19 AM I think you could read your own meter and call it in ? Posted by : Phillip | September 14 , 2011 10:35 AM My bill be $ 40 less than last summer for August . I admit I 've be more careful about my power usage , but I never turn my a/c off for the whole month , unlike June and July when I be away or the temp let me let in fresh air . BGE a all private utility exist to make a profit . They will cut corner , use deceptive but not illegal practice , whatever it take to give their stockholder and executive more in their pocket . Whatever genius decide that power generation should be private not government be wrong , because the mantra for private industry be n't serve the public , but make profit . Posted by : cate58 | September 14 , 2011 11:54 AM WOW ! What a bunch of whiner ! First , let me state that I be not an employee of BGE nor be anyone in my family . We be so fortunate to live in an area where we have reliable and dependable and relatively inexpensive utility . I wonder how many of the people complain here pay a much or more for cable tv and internet service a they do for the utility that allow them to utilize the cable and internet . Does anyone really think that BGE intentionally drag their foot when it come to restoring power after Irene move through the area because there be also a lot of whining about that . BGE make nothing off of their electric consumer if the consumer be n't use any electricity so they be redeploy meter reader to help expedite the reconnection of customer to their electricty . Stop complaining and be grateful that we have access to reliable utility unlike much of the world that live in complete darkness when the sun go down because they have nothing except maybe some candle or lantern to light the night , if they 're lucky . Posted by : Evesham | September 14 , 2011 12:06 PM You people that be get $ 300- $ 500 bill need to stop be such energy hog . You good be live in a 5,000 sqft . house to be get a bill that insanely high . Posted by : Steve | September 14 , 2011 12:37 PM Most folk bill cycle mean they have yet to see a bill that include the hurricane time period . But upon close inspection I see that our electricity DELIVERY rate in the last 6 month be up an average of 25 % over last year . In july it be 32 % high . The average household be on track to pay $ 80 more this year than last to have BGE DELIVER their electricity . A 24 % bump for worse service ... ..hmm ... me think the PSC be not do it job . Posted by : laura | September 14 , 2011 1:18 PM I dare them to try to do this to me . I still do n't have power from Hurricane Irene because I have to get electrical work done . Between the red tape I have to cut through between them and the city of Baltimore it have become a pain just to get my power back on . Posted by : Calvin | September 14 , 2011 2:23 PM Evesham be a Constellation Stock holder . And Evesham , people be not complain that BGE delay repair - but that their bill should be less ( or at least not high ) due to the lack of electricity for 1 week . Jimbo - when you be on a fix income - $ 25 more per month be a lot . I be talk to a woman last week . Her house straddle PA/MD . The neighbor in PA have their power within 24 hour with Pepco . The MD folk wait a week for BGE repair .

Another be that during a power outage , the utility know exactly who be without power . Thursday after the storm , BGE call u to see if we have power ( we do n't ) . Once the power be back on , they call u again to see if power be restore . I have call in , several time , to report power out , I be surprise they do n't have a good way to determine if we have power or not . Posted by : Maggie | September 15 , 2011 7:30 AM The Smart Grid and all it benefit can be achieve through other , safer technology such a have be do in Italy . It be not necessary to harm health , invade privacy , and raise rate in order to have a Smart Grid . Posted by : Ruthie Kalib Eisenberg | September 15 , 2011 8:10 PM I have to question the `` world health organization '' just like I question the `` IMF '' or the `` United Nations '' . My cell phone be probably more likely to cause me harm than a smart meter . The water I drink from Baltimore city be probably lace with high amount of lead and or mercury . The air I breath be fill with toxin from the car you drive . The chicken and milk I drink be fill with hormone . So what do i do ? Complain about smart grid ? Hell , it 's probably safe than everything else I just talk about . I 'll take smart grid over Baltimore City water purposely lased with fluoride to help 'protect me ' any day , I 'll take smart grid over milk saturate with chemical that be to help 'protect ' me from illness . The more important question . Will smart grid affect radio frequency like Broad Band over Power line do a few year back make it so emergency responder and ham radio operator receive interference when communicate . That 's my real question ! Posted by : Phillip | September 19 , 2011 10:46 AM Could Robert Williams who write on Sept. 15th,2011 , put together an invaluable resource sheet on Smart Meters , please contact Maryland Residents Against Smart Meters at info @ MarylandResidentsAgainstSmartMeters.org . Smart Meter radiation need to be compare to cell tower radiation , not cell phone radiation , accord to lead expert . Each build with a Smart Meter become part of an interconnect microwave transmission system ( mesh network ) , thus blanket entire neighborhood with pulse microwave radiation . So it 's important to speak with your neighbor . You can turn off your cell phone . You ca n't turn off your Smart Meter . It operate 24/7 . According to Sage Associates , have a Smart Meter be like living within 500 foot of a major cell tower . According to UC Nuclear expert , the exposure be at least 100x the exposure from a cell phone .
