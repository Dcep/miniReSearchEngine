Business Your Money Extending life of razor blade leave user dry By GREGORY KARP , a personal finance writer for The Morning Call , a Tribune Co. newspaper in Allentown , Pa Fencing Finance Consumers Marketing Newspaper and Magazine Personal Finance Tribune Media Some everyday purchase seem to tick off consumer more than others . Gasoline and inkjet cartridge be example . Another be razor blades . The razor industry be know for a marketing strategy in which the seller take a loss on the device , the razor handle , and make money on refill , the blade . That model be use by inkjet printer and cartridge , video-game console and game and mobile phone and wireless service , among others . The razor industry have undergo an amazing run of one-upsmanship . Two-blade razor be better by the introduction of three-blade cartridge by Gillette , then four-blade cartridge by Schick , then five-blade razor with lubricate strip , some with vibrating handle , from Gillette . Each be tout to give a closer , more comfortable shave than the last . Whether you be shave your face or your leg , you could be pay several dollar each for these multiple-blade cartridge refill . To save money , you could buy cheap blade , but many consumer claim the more expensive new razor be , indeed , superior . So the other way to spend less be to make the blade last longer . How can consumer make razor blade last longer ? There be many propose method . But Gillette and Schick decline to allow interview with executive or blade-research personnel to discuss them . The most a Gillette spokeswoman would say by e-mail be that `` Gillette scientist have not see any data to substantiate '' method of make blade last longer . Schick would not comment at all . c Comments I have be shave with the same razor blade for 9 month before change razor blade . After shave , I completely rinse off the blade to insure there be no facial hair or shave cream on the blade or razor and then dry it on a towel . I then store the razor in a container of mineral oil ... terinick214 at 10:50 AM July 08 , 2014 Add a comment See all comment 1 Granted , some propose way of extend blade life seem far-fetched or impractical for everyday consumer . They include cryogenically freeze blade , coat or submerge blade in various oil or rub alcohol , store blade in a magnetic holder to avoid warping or place your razor in a prism to somehow take advantage of the earth 's magnetic property . But one very simple method have great allure and at least anecdotal support : dry your razor blade after shave . The concept be this : Razor blade dullness stem more from oxidation , microscopic rusting , than from contact with whisker . Water that sits on blade between shave cause the oxidation . Corrosion can cause metal on the blade to flake off and the edge to become blunt and jag . That result in blade pull and tear hair instead of cleanly slice through them . Degraded performance prompt most people to ditch the blade for a new one . If water cause rust , and rust be the main culprit of blade dullness , then , presumably , dry your razor blade could increase the life of blade . A high-profile test of this happen when consumer-advocate radio host Clark Howard of Atlanta use a 17-cent disposable razor for an entire year . He say he extend blade life by blotting his razor dry with a towel after use . Howard 's report intrigue Atlanta resident Brian Cohn , who then try it himself . Cohn say his result be n't quite a good but still amaze . Instead of blade last the usual 10 day to two week , his blade last five to six month . `` I just could n't get over it , '' he say . `` I truly hat buy razor blade . '' Cohn have since invent a razor-storage device with a small fan for drying razor . He hop to market it under the name RazorPro . Because the only evidence he have be anecdotal , he pay for testing research from an independent laboratory , 360-Degree Testing Service of Yonkers , N.Y . It test a two-blade razor from Bic , a three-blade razor from Gillette and a four-blade razor from Schick . The result ? Using the fan device to dry blade extend blade life an average of 122 percent , or more than double . None of this be conclusive proof that dry your blade after shave will make them last longer . But it 's worth a try , especially if you use expensive cartridge . If it do n't work for you , you 've lose very little . Other idea for reduce shave expense be to buy cheap disposable razor , use an electric razor or use coupon for name-brand cartridge . Or you could shave less . Men can grow a beard , for example . For woman , well , let hair grow be an individual choice . - - - Sharp solution These idea , use individually or together , be free : Shake it up . With a loose wrist , shake the razor vigorously for several second to dislodge water droplet from blade . Or tap the razor handle on the edge of the sink . Towel it off . Blot , do n't rub , the blade cartridge on a towel or dry washcloth . Blow it dry . Use a hair dryer or fan to dry blade of the razor . Do n't blow dry razor too long or you might end up spending more on electricity than you save on razor blade . About 10 second should suffice . Put it away . Store your razor outside the bathroom to avoid steam and humidity from shower get to blade . Or store the dry razor in a resealable plastic bag . Soften hair . To the extent that wear result from contact with whisker instead of oxidation , shave only after soften hair with a moisturizing soap . After apply shave cream or gel , do n't shave right away . Allow time for hair to soften further . -- Gregory Karp -- -- -- -- -- Gregory Karp be a personal finance writer for The Morning Call , a Tribune Co. newspaper in Allentown , Pa.
