Mr Shine 04-25-2014 , 06:02 AM I do n't , and I do n't recall ever see anyone else ever microwave something on anything other than full power or defrost . Do you use any of the other setting ? Alessan 04-25-2014 , 06:10 AM The only button I ever press be the 30-second quick start and the stop button . I have no idea what any of the other button do . engineer_comp_geek 04-25-2014 , 06:16 AM I ca n't even remember the last time I use defrost . SciFiSam 04-25-2014 , 06:17 AM The only button I ever press be the 30-second quick start and the stop button . I have no idea what any of the other button do . Same here . There seem to be all sort of possible setting , but I 've never use them . bobot 04-25-2014 , 06:22 AM My microwave 's power setting be in 10 increment , 1-10 , and I use most of them . Power Level be the first button I hit , before entering the time . I never before thought this be unusual . Arrogance Ex Machina 04-25-2014 , 07:05 AM My oven only have two setting , full power and defrost . Besides those there 's the dial to set the time and that 's it . chrisk 04-25-2014 , 07:07 AM I 've start use low power setting than max to steam vegetable for cook . ( I like my carrot mushy . ) 3 minute at max , then stir , then 10 minute at power level 3 , stir again , 10 minute at power level four . Then they 're ready . ; ) Broomstick 04-25-2014 , 07:07 AM I do n't , and I do n't recall ever see anyone else ever microwave something on anything other than full power or defrost . Do you use any of the other setting ? I actually never use defrost . I do use the 50 % and 80 % power setting when cook rice and pasta . JohnT 04-25-2014 , 07:11 AM I do n't , and I do n't recall ever see anyone else ever microwave something on anything other than full power or defrost . Do you use any of the other setting ? Potatoes get cook at a ( 1-9 setting ) power level 4 . Popcorn have it own button ! ; ) El_Kabong 04-25-2014 , 07:15 AM Mine have various 'Reheat ' setting , which , along with the 'Popcorn ' option , be actually the one I use most often . I think I 've only use defrost a half a dozen time in ten year . I 've use full Warp Factor 10 power quite a bit more than that , however . Shoeless 04-25-2014 , 07:17 AM Potatoes get cook at a ( 1-9 setting ) power level 4 . Popcorn have it own button ! ; ) And what 's that popcorn button for ? : confuse : Nearly every microwave popcorn I 've ever use have say NOT to use the popcorn set . Heracles 04-25-2014 , 07:58 AM Our microwave oven be a Panasonic Genius II ( similar to the one shown here ( http : //forums.redflagdeals.com/how-long-can-i-use-my-seemly-working-microwave-oven-before-unsafe-984887/ ) ) from the early 1980s . It 's get a table on the front listing the various thing that can be cook automatically use the built-in program . To start it normally , you have to select among 5 power level , then select the duration . We frequently use level 5 ( max ) , 4 and 3 . Telemark 04-25-2014 , 08:08 AM I mainly use full power or defrost , but at least once a week I 'll set the exact power level I want . Usually it 's for something that 's difficult to defrost or something I want cook a particular way . Cheesesteak 04-25-2014 , 08:08 AM I use the power level all the time , especially when reheat food . I 'll double the time and put the power at 50 % , so thing heat more evenly . We also use the Beverage button , which be handy to get a hot beverage that be n't go to explode when you put the sugar in . Tzigone 04-25-2014 , 09:00 AM I use the beverage button , the popcorn button , and power level 3 ( for reheating pizza or any bakery item , include warming up cooky ) in addition to full power . Nava 04-25-2014 , 09:02 AM I actually never use defrost . I do use the 50 % and 80 % power setting when cook rice and pasta . Those plus the `` quickset '' button . Tom Tildrum 04-25-2014 , 09:49 AM I use the power level all the time , especially when reheat food . I 'll double the time and put the power at 50 % , so thing heat more evenly . I do that with the baby 's food . I 'm never sure whether 1 minute at 50 % be really any different from 30 second at full power , though . I 've also have good luck with the Potato button , at least when I 'm cook potato . silenus 04-25-2014 , 09:55 AM I use the `` Reheat '' button all the time . Much more control than full power . california jobcase 04-25-2014 , 10:04 AM 3 minute on power 2 defrosts two bone and skin chicken thigh to perfect dicing firmness . I add cumin , garlic , cayenne , and black pepper . I then cook the chicken and make awesome taco . JKilez 04-25-2014 , 10:10 AM I use the power level all the time , especially when reheat food . I 'll double the time and put the power at 50 % , so thing heat more evenly . Ditto . Additionally , I use low set when make rice or oatmeal ( full power initially , and then low power to cook ) . johnpost 04-25-2014 , 10:16 AM the number only have some mean when full number range the power of the oven be state . intermediate number can work well with large volume to heat thoroughly without stir and not burn . SmellMyWort 04-25-2014 , 10:26 AM And what 's that popcorn button for ? : confuse : Nearly every microwave popcorn I 've ever use have say NOT to use the popcorn set . That sound like CYA language to me . The popcorn company realize that there be people out there who will just throw the bag in , push the button , and leave it , when in fact , it be n't that precise and need to be monitor . I use the popcorn button on my microwave and there be usually at least 30 second leave when I take it out , well long enough to burn it if leave for the complete cycle . As for the OP , in addition to full power , defrost , and popcorn , I use the reheat setting , the potato set , and I experiment with various power level to avoid overcooking the edge of thing . Turble 04-25-2014 , 11:31 AM Mine have lot of button . The one I use a lot : Rice Baked Potato Veggies - Fresh / Frozen Butter - Soften / Melt Reheat - 1 Dinner Plate - 2 Soup/Sauce - 3 Casserole - ( there be a 4 but I do n't know offhand what it be ) PacifistPorcupine 04-25-2014 , 01:04 PM I use `` warm '' for melt butter . My oven be ancient ( it have dial ! ) so time be hit or miss . Amateur Barbarian 04-25-2014 , 01:33 PM Microwaves vary considerably in power . If you have something other than a $ 50 Wal*mart dorm-room special , it probably have more power than a little box . I frequently use long time at 50 % power on thing that be not entirely liquid . All or mostly water ? Zap it at full power . Soup , chili or vegetable ? They 'll cook much well , with no dried edge , hot spot , boil over and spatter at half power . You need to give the water-borne heat time to spread through the denser material without boil spot . I have other power level I 've learn to use with specific task and item . I 'd have to relearn them with a new oven , even one of the same approximate power . But other than that , and the 30-seconds-per-press quickstart , I do n't think I 've ever use a microwave preset . They 're kind of the successor to `` 18-speed blender '' and the like . Ca n't think of a time I 've try one and it work satisfactorily . sciurophobic 04-25-2014 , 01:48 PM I ask a similar question back in '07 . Some of the same people respond back then too ( silenus ) Why 10 power level on microwave ? ( http : //boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/showthread.php ? t=434503 ) racepug 04-25-2014 , 01:50 PM For some reason ( probably , in my mind , an effort to avoid mishap ) I generally prefer to run mine at about 30 % for more minute instead of at full power for few . That 's the one I have at home . At work I use it at 100 % ( for less time ) because A ) there be other people use it at work besides me , B ) I have more of a time constraint when I 'm have lunch at work than I generally do when I 'm at home , and C ) the one where I work right now have a mess up display which make it pretty hard to read . Set time and `` Start '' be all I bother to do with that one . levdrakon 04-25-2014 , 01:55 PM I mostly use the full power one minute quick button . If it 's a freeze dinner I 'll punch in the minute . I 've try to figure out how to do 5 minute at 50 % but it 's hopeless . All the `` hotdog '' type presets be useless to me . Ca n't get them to work . My old microwave have a 2.5 minute popcorn present that work , but my current one do n't . Maybe it do . I do n't know . jtur88 04-25-2014 , 02:11 PM I get my microwave out of the dumpster , and I use whatever button still work on the keypad . Buck Godot 04-25-2014 , 05:52 PM I find that certain prepackaged microwave soup and noodle be design for a low power microwave and will boil over on full power . So I cook those at 80 % power . jnglmassiv 04-25-2014 , 09:48 PM I frequently use long time at 50 % power on thing that be not entirely liquid . All or mostly water ? Zap it at full power . Soup , chili or vegetable ? They 'll cook much well , with no dried edge , hot spot , boil over and spatter at half power . You need to give the water-borne heat time to spread through the denser material without boil spot . I have other power level I 've learn to use with specific task and items.This be my method a well . When reheat lunch at work or leftover from last night , even most soup or chili , two minute at 50 % be usually just right . If it be particularly liquidy or something like a cup of coffee , max power . I 'm also fairly strict on cover the food with a glass or porcelain bowl and let it sit for a bit after the two minute . If the bowl be hot to the touch when time 's up , the food be probably ready . aceplace57 04-25-2014 , 10:02 PM Pastrys like doughnut do well at 50 % for 15 second . The glaze fall off if your overheat them . A day old pastry taste so much well heat . I use 50 % to soften butter . Most thing I heat at 100 % . I do n't know how to use defrost mode on my new microwave . Never need it that badly . Theres some pre-programmed mode for specific food that I never have use either . Baker 04-25-2014 , 11:11 PM In answer to the OP , nope . And I only use a microwave at work , a I do n't own one myself . Guinastasia 04-25-2014 , 11:19 PM Sometimes I use the timer button if I 'm cook something in the oven , because the dog HATES the sound of the oven timer when it go off . So it 's easy to use the microwave one . Rhiannon8404 04-25-2014 , 11:25 PM Buttons we use : Add 30 sec 2 minute 3 minute ( none of the other button on the number pad work so if you want more than 3 minute you have to keep adding 30 sec . ) Stop drewtwo99 04-25-2014 , 11:25 PM I use low power ( 1 or 2 ) for melting butter . Trying to use anything else be suboptimal . I also use the reheat button a lot , it 's nice for leftover . PunditLisa 04-25-2014 , 11:44 PM I use `` Reheat '' all the time . I use `` Popcorn '' and `` Vegetables - Baked Potato '' a lot . I also use `` Add 30 second . '' And of course , I use the Timer constantly . SeaDragonTattoo 04-26-2014 , 01:10 AM I have a circa 2000 Sharp Sensor that have preset button for different thing like pastry , freeze pastry , freeze vegetable , freeze dinner , popcorn , potatoes , warm drink , and defrost by the 1/2 pound and for different meat . It work wonderfully , I do n't know how it do it . It 's like a little white magic box in my kitchen . It do n't have some pre-set time for thing like freeze dinner ; it seem to sense a certain amount of steam or something , and do n't put a time on the display until it `` know '' there 's 1 or 2 minute remain , it 's always different ( but the same for the same dinner ) . I do my own timing and percentage for delicate thing like melt butter or soften cream cheese without exploding . Usually 30 % . kk fusion 04-26-2014 , 01:09 PM Not even defrost . A microwave be binary on/off . Hari Seldon 04-27-2014 , 11:59 AM I occasionally use defrost . What I mainly use be 1 , ... ,5 which run it at high set for that many minute ( I can not find a microwave now that have that feature ) and the 30 sec button which both add 30 second or run for the 30 sec . I never cook anything in the microwave . Missy2U 04-27-2014 , 05:02 PM I rarely use it , but when I do , it 's Beverage - 1 ( for tea ) , Defrost ( I forget the different option ) and Frozen Entree - 10 oz . ( I just used it to reheat freeze lasagna . ) Doug K . 04-27-2014 , 09:15 PM Our microwave have two setting : on and off . There be no button except for the one to open the door , only a knob that you turn to the desire time . To turn it off you turn the knob back to zero . randompattern 04-27-2014 , 09:38 PM Always full power , I use the 30 sec . quick launch button a lot . Side note : I do n't remember where , but I read an article online about laziness and one guy write , `` When I need to use the microwave for 1 minute I always push 1:11 because I do n't feel like reaching all the way down to push the zero button . '' Weedy 04-27-2014 , 09:49 PM Thanks to this thread , I have be experiment with different power level on the microwave . Turns out it 's actually possible to make porridge in the microwave without it boil over if you use a low power set for long . Thanks to the SDMB , my morning be much easy now . Hockey Monkey 04-27-2014 , 10:54 PM I use 50 % power almost all the time . Think about your regular oven - 350 degree be the most commonly used temp and that be consider to be medium heat . You would n't reheat leftover at 500 degree in your oven , so do n't reheat them at full power in your microwave either . I only use full power if I have a freeze something and the instruction on the package say to do so , OR if I 'm cook something from a raw state and not simply reheat . Guess what ? Leftovers still taste good when they be reheat properly ! Pai325 04-28-2014 , 12:46 AM I 've never use defrost . I use the power button when I reheat food or it would be hard in some spot and cold in others . Otherwise it 's full power ( steam vegetable bag , popcorn , boil water ) . TheLoadedDog 04-28-2014 , 12:55 AM This reminds me of back when I be in high school , and all my friend ' mother be sign up for weird `` microwave cookery '' class . They be new tech , and my family do n't have one . Anyway , I end up get one a an adult in the 90 . Cooking ? Ha ! Could n't do jack with the thing . I 've only ever use them for simply nuke the crap out of stuff . Well , that 's not entirely true - I 've try defrost a few time , but it never seem to work . I get burnt bit and still-frozen bit . Nuking to heat stuff ? They be brilliant . Anything else ? I 'll use the stove top . Seanette 04-28-2014 , 01:22 AM I do n't , and I do n't recall ever see anyone else ever microwave something on anything other than full power or defrost . Do you use any of the other setting ? I have a 1250-watt microwave , so when I 'm cook something with direction write for the standard 1100-watt model , I 'll drop to 80 % power . I 've also use low setting for task like soften butter . I do n't normally use defrost because I dislike the result . My microwave have a `` sensor reheat '' option that figure out time and temperature need to heat my food for me . Nice when I 'm not yet completely awake . : D Tim R. Mortiss 04-28-2014 , 02:09 AM I mostly use the `` add 30 second '' button . But occasionally I use the power level button ( 60 or 70 % usually ) to reheat largish item like meatloaf or roast . FairyChatMom 04-28-2014 , 07:51 AM I 've use mo
