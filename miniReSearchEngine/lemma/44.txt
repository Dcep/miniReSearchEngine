We argue that economy of scale , economy of scope and effect of learn should have an impact on the production of energy efficient housing service . To test our hypothesis , we use a unique dataset derive from energy consumption bill . The data contain information on the exact energy requirement of a dwelling , it size , age and the level of refurbishment . In particular , we rely on information on roughly 100,000 multifamily house . Besides owner characteristic and refurbishment effort , we introduce several control variable to capture vintage , size and spatial effect . We find strong evidence for the presence of firm-specific , in particular size effect on the energetic outcome of refurbishment . We find that professional housing company ( a company own more than 1000 flat in their portfolio ) reduce the energy requirement by about 37.1 % when major part ( roof , facade , windows , basement ceiling and heating system ) of the dwelling be refurbish within the last 15 year . In contrast , single unit owner ( own up to 20 flat ) reduce energy requirement only by 12.3 % , even when for dwell attribute like size , age and spatial location be control for . Moreover , difference between firm type increase with refurbishment effort . This inquiry contribute to the literature on housing service supply a well a to the ongoing political debate on the reduction of CO2 emission . For example , the introduction of Germanys federal governmental concept for climate protection in autumn 2010 let to a fierce controversy on the feasibility of the introduce target on energy efficiency improvement in the exist housing stock in particular because of the plan to introduce redevelopment obligation for all landlord . After intense protest , this strategy be withdraw , predominantly because the law do not distinguish between real estate characteristic . The present paper add the aspect of firm size to the discussion . Download Info If you experience problem download a file , check if you have the proper application to view it first .
