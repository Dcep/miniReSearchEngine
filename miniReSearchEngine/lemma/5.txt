Banned : 10 most popular vacuum and which will go Lower wattage cleaner can save around 12.48 a year over the most powerful machine in energy bill , accord to calculation by The Telegraph . But manufacturer argue that the new rule wo n't save householder money in energy consumption , because people will simply clean their home for long . However , energy expert have dismiss this claim . New vacuum rule : what 's change ? Manufacturers wo n't be able to produce any motor exceed 1,600 watt or export them to the UK . The maximum wattage will be lower even far to 900 watt in 2017 . The current average on the market be about 1,800 watt . Currently vacuum cleaner be the only product subject to the ban although next year the EU plan to scrutinise other household appliance . When you buy a vacuum in shop and online , it will be label from A to G accord to it energy efficiency and performance . As customer rush to snap up the most powerful machine , retailer report a 50pc rise in customer purchase vacuum with motor above the 1,600 threshold . Tesco report a 44pc increase in sale , Currys say that it have sell out of it 2,000 to 2,300 watt Hoover Breeze and Pet model , and AO.com sell out of 2,000 watt model . Dyson : 'Boffin bureaucrat be flawed' Inventor Sir James Dyson be now seek a judicial review on the matter , even though none of his vacuum exceed the new limit . Writing for The Telegraph , Sir James criticise the `` flaw '' energy efficiency label . `` It mislead shopper , '' he say . `` The boffin bureaucrat have be test virgin vacuum cleaner in a sterile laboratory . `` All this mean that the grade on the label be not representative of how the vacuum will work in the real world . '' Q . How much could I save by using a less powerful vacuum ? A . You could save an estimate 12.48 a year by switching from the most powerful to the least powerful vacuum . This be base on the cost difference of use a 2,400 watt vacuum cleaner versus a 1,200 watt vacuum cleaner for 2 hour each week . To work out the cost of use your vacuum cleaner , you need to know it energy consumption and the pence-per-kWh charged by your electricity provider . A 1,200 watt vacuum cleaner leave switch on for an hour be equal to 1.2 kWh ( divide 1,200 watt by 1,000 to get the kWh ) so you multiply 1.2 kWh by your provider 's kWh price , to get the cost . So use this vacuum would cost 12p for an hour , if you be with a provider that charge 10p per kWh or 12.48 to vacuum for 2 hour a week over the course of a year . If you have a 2,400 watt vacuum cleaner , the same person would spend 24p for an hour 's vacuuming or 24.96 for the same cleaning regime over the course of a year . Q . But be n't high power vacuum more effective ? A . Dr Kevin Lane , from Oxford University 's Environmental Change Institute , say that this be a myth he argue that the least powerful model could be just a effective . `` Consumers will not have to use their new vacuum cleaner noticeably long to compensate , '' he say . Dr Lane say that manufacturer would redesign their high power product to be more efficient so that they perform just a well . `` They will also be able to make a more inform choice supplier will be less able to put poorly perform product on to the market . '' He say that it be a myth that a machine 's power consumption mean more clean or suction power . Sir James Dyson be sceptical of the new energy label . `` What you see , be not necessarily what you get , '' he say . `` Of course it 's understandable and logical from consumer perspective , and some manufacturer marketing play up to this giving the impression that big be good . '' Matthew Leach , Professor of Energy Systems at the University of Surrey , say that there be no one-to-one relationship between power consumption and effectiveness . He say : `` Some of the high perform model available on the market such a the Dysons be not the high power rating , and so it be possible to clean well with low power use . Prof Leach predict a rapid response by manufacturer to re-design the most power hungry machine . He say : `` They will bring good design forward which manage to have similar suction power for the low electricity consumption , a they now have to think directly about energy use , and not just suction power in their design . '' Q . So which vacuum be best to buy ? A . The vacuum cleaner market be a confusing mix of measurement include watt , air watt and litre capacity . But these unit be not a critical a you might think , accord to Charles Gordon , founder of advice website whatvacuum.com . He say : `` A 1,500 watt motor , for example , be quite sufficient it how it pick up dirt and what it emit into the air that be important . '' Mr Gordon add that the new A to G rating would be a useful point of reference for customer . `` At last the consumer have the opportunity of actually read what the product performance , whereas now we 're perplex by manufacturer-speak . '' `` Now we have a measure meant like togs for duvet that everyone can understand , '' he say . Mr Gordon say that choosing the best vacuum depend on your home and any allergy you may have . `` Youve get to identify what your house need be . If you have a lot of hard floor , then theres no point get an upright cleaner , you need a cylinder or a tank . `` Likewise , if youve got lot of carpet an upright be by far the best way to clean your carpet . `` Weight be critical both for use less electricity , and for practical reason , for example if an elderly person need to carry it up the stair .
