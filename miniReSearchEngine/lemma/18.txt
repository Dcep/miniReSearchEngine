Last update : June 2013 The calculator at right will give you a rough idea of how much electricity something us and how much it cost you . But there be some important caveat : Electricity rate vary widely . I've find rate from 12 to 50 per kWh from the same provider . If you want result that be anywhere close to accurate , you 'll need to check your own electric bill and find your actual kWh rate . Your bill might have multiple kWh rate ( e.g. , one for `` delivery '' and one for `` fuel '' ) , and in that case you should to add up them all up to get the total kWh rate . Most rate be tiered , meaning the high your use , the high the rate . You should generally enter your high tier into the calculator , because any energy you save will save you money at that high tiered rate . Electrical use varies from model to model . I think this would be obvious , but in hundred of blog and forum people say thing like , `` Mr. Electricity say a computer use 150 watt , '' which be a mischaracterization . The calculator and table figure be just example . ( See how to misquote this website . ) Some device use vary amount of electricity . An easy example be an oven , whose energy use depends on how high you crank it . Perhaps a less obvious example be a washing machine , which effectively use phenomenally more energy if you wash in hot rather than cold . Then there 's the refrigerator , which alternate between period of full energy use while the compressor be run , and then next to nothing when the compressor shuts off . ( To solve this problem for fridge , the calculator list the average wattage over time , not the high amount use when the compressor run . ) Most device do n't run 24/7 . Therefore the '' Hours per Day '' and `` Days per Month '' field in the calculator be crucial . Even so , you might not have a good idea about how various appliance run . So below we 'll discuss which item use the most energy in a typical home . You can also measure a device 's usage yourself , which give you the best information for your own situation .

This be to put battery into perspective . If you could power your clock radio with a AA battery , it would n't even last an hour . We have more on battery on our Guide to Household Batteries . Wattage varies from model to model ! Figures above be example . See How to Misquote this Website . Data for specific model of appliance be available at the Power Consumption Database . Some device use a little energy even when they 're not on . This be call standby power , or vampire power . In most case it 's negligible , the main exception be cable TV box . My standby power page have more info on this . U.S. household energy Electrical usage of household item The chart at right show how the average home use energy ( not just electricity ) in 2007 . ( Dept . of Energy ) Of course , heating be a big chunk in the winter and air condition be a big chunk in the summer . For example , AC account for 60-70 % of the average home 's summertime power bill in Austin . ( Austin Energy ) Places which be n't a hot in summer do n't get a break , because they 're generally cold in winter and so more be spend on heating . Below at right be the energy use for an all-electric home in Tallahassee , Florida , which show that 60 % of the energy go to heating and cool . ( City of Tallahassee ) At the bottom of this page be a chart show the relative use of various appliance . ( DoE ) Note that this do n't really jibe with the pie chart above from the DoE . ( Refrigerators and appliance use different amount in the different chart . ) If I can ever find the time , I 'll try to make my own chart . Here be some other website that give sample cost for various household item consider how much those item be use : Seattle Light Cornhusker Public Power District Individual Appliances At far right be a table listing example of the wattage of common household appliance . Appliances that create or remove heat use the most electricity . In the table at right , appliance that make thing hot be list in red and one that make thing cold be list in blue . As you can see , together they dwarf everything else on the list . Do n't like my table ? Here 's another table from Generator Sales . A database which list power data for specific model of product be Power Consumption Database . Remember that electrical usage varies from model to model , and that the table on this site be just example . ( See how to misinterpret this website . ) Figuring the use of your own item The best way to know how much energy your stuff us be to measure it . You can do that easily with a cheap watt-hour meter , or you can do it for free by timing your electric meter . I explain all this on the page about measure your electrical use . A shortcut , though a little less accurate , be to just look at the product 's label . Nearly everything you can plug into the wall have a label that say how much electricity it use . ( It may be print directly into the plastic or metal . ) You may have to hunt for the label . It 's often locate on the bottom or side of the device , or possibly where the power cord enters the unit . If the device be power with an AC/DC adapter , the electrical rating be usually list on the adapter itself . If the label give only the number of amp and not the number of watt , then just multiply the amp by 120 to get the number of watt . ( Amps x Volts = Watts , and most U.S. electricity be ~120 volt . So a hot plate rat at 6 amp us 6 x 120 = 720 watt , on the high set . Most other country use 240 volt instead of 120 , so outside of North America and Japan use 240 instead of 120 in your calculation . ) Note that if a device be power by a transformer ( one of those great big plug ) , then the transformer have convert the electricity from AC to DC , so you need to multiply by the DC voltage , not the AC voltage of 120 . For example , if the device say `` INPUT 9V , 0.5A '' , then that 's 9 volt x 0.5 amp = 4.5 watt . You may have notice that appliance may be label 110 , 115 , or 120 volt . U.S. appliance be actually design to accept a range of voltage , between 110-120 volt , and the exact voltage come out of your electrical socket can vary depend on condition at the power plant and in your own home . Let 's just agree that when we say 120 volt , we understand that it 's actually a range from 110-120 . And just use 120 for your calculation ( unless you 're outside of North America or Japan , in which case you probably have 220-240 volt ) . Your device might actually list a huge voltage range , like 100-240V . That just mean that it will work with any country 's voltage . For your calculation , use the voltage for the country where you 're plug the device in . Some important caveat : The amount of electricity list on the label be the maximum amount that the appliance will ever use . For example , a 300-watt refrigerator will only run at 300 watt when the compressor 's running ( which be when it make that hum sound , indicate that it 's actually chill the air inside ) . Most of the time the fridge just sit there , use only 5 watt or so for it electronics . If the amount of work done by a device varies up and down , then so do it energy use . ( e.g. , a stereo that can be turn up or down , an oven that can be set at various temperature , a fridge that sometimes run and sometimes do n't , a computer that sometimes spin it various drive and sometimes have to use more of it brainpower , etc . ) The label on computer be particularly useless ; a computer label at 300 watt probably use only about 100 . ( More on computers' electrical use . ) In just a bit we 'll cover how to measure the actual amount of electricity be use by a device Many consumer item be advertise accord to their power output , not input . That mean the stereo that say 30 watt on the box might actually require 50 watt to make 30 watt of sound ( assume the volume be crank ) , and your 900-watt microwave oven might actually use 1400 watt ( on it high set ) . That's because all electrical device be inefficient -- they have to use some extra energy to do what they do . Some device use energy even when they 're not on . ( Standby power ) Exercise : Pretend there 's an energy crisis and they start ration electricity . You 're give a bonus of 1000 watt-hour of electricity to use because you win a special drawing . If you 're choose between use your stereo or your central air conditioner , how long could you run each ? Assume that your stereo us 30 watt and your AC us 3500 watt . ( see answer ) 1000 Wh will run a 30-watt stereo for 1000 / 30 = 33 hour . 1000 Wh will run a 3500-watt AC for 1000 / 3500 = 0.29 hour ( 17 minute ) . Exercise : The power adapter on your laptop computer say it output be 24V and 1.875 amp . The input spec be n't list for some reason . What 's the maximum number of watt your computer could ever use ? ( see answer ) 24V x 1.875a = 45 watt Your adapter could draw a little more than this , because it 's a little inefficient at convert the 120V to 24V , but that do n't really matter because your computer will rarely need the full 45 watt anyway ( which would require all the drive to be spin and the processor to be fully busy ) . Energy-saving strategy Here 's how much various strategy can save you . Easy Strategies Strategy Up front cost Savings per year ( 1 ) Use space heater to heat only the room you 're in ( rather than a central system that heat the whole house ) , and turn off the heat when you 're not home . $ 80 $ 1023 ( 2 ) Use ceiling fan instead of the air conditioner $ 100 if you do n't already have ceiling fan $ 438 ( 3 ) Turn off light you 're not use $ 0 $ 274 ( 4 ) Use a clothesline or a laundry rack instead of a dryer $ 20 $ 196 ( 5 ) Sleep your computer when you 're not use it $ 0 $ 178 ( 6 ) Wash laundry in cold water instead of hot or warm none $ 152 ( 7 ) Turn off a single 100-watt light bulb , from run constantly $ 0 $ 131 ( 8 ) Replace ten 60-watt light bulb with compact fluorescent $ 32 $ 123 Total $ 232 once $ 2515 every year Aggressive Strategies ( 9 ) Replace top-loading washer with front-loading washer $ 500 $ 99 ( 10 ) Replace 1992 fridge with a new Energy Star model $ 440 $ 75 Total $ 940 once $ 174 every year Assumptions : ( Calculations be always only a good a the assumption . See how to misquote this website . ) Sample electrical rate of 15/kWh . ( 1 ) One 5000-watt central system , always on , run 40mins/hr . for four month , vs. two 1500-watt heater run 8 hour a day for four month . Of course , not everyone cant heat their living area adequately this way , but some can . ( 2 ) A 2.5-ton , 3500-watt AC 24 hour a day ( 15 mins/hr ) for five month , vs. two 48 '' ceiling fan on high ( 75 watt each ) , 12 hours/day . ( 3 ) Five 100-watt light bulb on for 10 hour a day when they do n't need to be . ( 4 ) 50/load a per the clothes dryer page , 7.5 load a week . ( 5 ) Computer on for 24 hrs/day @ 160 watt , vs. sleeping 21 hrs/day @ 5 watt ( 6 ) Electric water heater ; 7.5 loads/week . ( 8 ) CFL 's be 15 watt , light run 5.5 hour a day . ( 9 ) 1/3 hot wash , 2/3 warm wash , water heat electrically , electric dryer , 7.5 loads/week . Includes water cost . ( 10 ) Replacing a 900 kWh/year fridge with a 400 kWh/year Energy Star model . Non-Energy Star fridge cost $ 400 and save $ 60/yr . All fridge size be 18cf . Fridge price check at Sears in Nov. 2010 .
