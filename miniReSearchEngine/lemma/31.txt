Pellets wood briquette and wood chip be main drive force therefore . Their share on the overall energy consumption increase by far 26 % ( from 10851TJ to 13713TJ ) between 2009/2010 and 2011/2012 . With a contingent of 5.0 % they be significantly ahead of coal with 0.5 % . In2000 the proportion be with 1.5 % against 3.5 % the other way around . With 21.9 % or 59784TJ electricity occupies the top range on fuel level once again . Fuel wood with 19.9 % or 54117TJ again the most intensively used biofuel pass natural gas ( 54068TJ ) that occupy the third range just behind but clearly before fuel oil ( 48097TJ ) . District heat be able to increase it share from 6.9 % ( 2003/2004 ) to 10.7 % ( 2011/2012 ) continuously while natural gas and electricity keep their share . In opposition to that , fuel oil lose significant market share since 2003/2004 . Its share decline from 24.9 % to 20.1 % ( 2007/2008 ) and at least to 17.7 % in 2011/2012 . With share clearly below 2 % coal play a minor role during the last 10years . Taking into consideration the fuel use for space heating exclusively one can see a strong shift from oil between 2003 and 2012 it share decline by 8.7 % from 31.7 % to 23.0 % - to district heating and biofuels . District heat increase by 5.2 % from 7.3 % to 12.5 % and the biofuels grow by 5.1 % from 27.7 % to 32.8 % . The share of renewable heat ( ambient and solar heat ) show an increase from 1.2 % to 3.4 % while natural gas ( some 24 % ) remain rather constant during this period and electricity decrease by 1.2 % to 3.9 % . Top Gas journal 2006 A study on domestic natural gas consumption conduct in 2006 show annual consumption result a follow : space heating 12.80m ( =128.34181kWh ) by square meter , water heating 127m ( =1274.24193kWh ) and cook 11m ( =108.67838kWh ) by person und year . Top Electricity- and gas journal electricity and gas consumption a well a energy efficiency of Austrian household The Electricity- and gas journal describes a widespread collection of data on the electricity- and gas consumption in Austria starting in2008 ( time period : three to five year ; current period : 2012 ) . On the basis of household interview , the inventory of electrical appliance and it use be survey . Furthermore the household measure their specific electricity consumption of relevant appliance in use . Households connect to the natural gas grid also report data concern the consumption of natural gas for cook , water heating and space heating . With this data the specific power consumption of category of consumption such a space heating , water heating , light or large domestic appliance and entertainment electronics be calculate . The report of the Electricity - and gas journal 2012 includes the evaluation of the equipment of electrical appliance and the electricity - and gas consumption base on the category of consumption . Additional information on age , size and energy efficiency category of the exist appliance be analyze and incorporate into the calculation of the specific power consumption . Washing machine be notably young than stove . Some 37 % of the washing machine be young than 5years , in contrast to 22 % of the stove . The situation2008 be similar when 35 % of the wash machine and 25 % of the stove be young than 5years . Tumble dryer be clearly the youngest category of appliance - nearly half of them be young than 5years ( 2008and 2012as well ) . Rooms be still dominate by light bulb : 43 % of the light fitting be light bulb , 16 % energy save lamp and 10 % LEDs . In2008 light bulb dominate with still 51 % and the proportion of energy save lamp more than double from2008 to2012 ( 2008 : 7 % ; 2012 : 16 % ) . An average household in 2012 consumes 4187kWh which be 230kWh less than 2008 . Substantial category of consumption be electricity use for large domestic appliance ( 22.4 % ) , space heating ( 14.0 % ) and water heating ( 13.8 % ) . Like in2008 large domestic appliance a well a fridge and freezer together consume around 30 % of the power . The stand -by-consumption amount to 3.2 % of the power consumption 1 % less than2008 . During the winter period the electricity consumption average 14.1kWh perday . Therefore it be about 30 % high than during the summer period with 9.8kWh ( 2008 : 14.4kWh in winter and 9.7kWh in summer ) . In winter , distinctly more electricity be spend on space heating light and dry laundry . Top Modelling of electricity consumption in private household in Austria accord to type of usage Within this project a method for linking data record relate to electricity consumption in private household from different survey ( household energy consumption 2004 , 2006 , 2008 and 2010 survey with the electricity and gas journal 2008 ) by mean of statistical matching be develop . In addition to information about the heating system , overall electricity consumption , electricity consumption for space heating , water heating and cook , the model also include socio-economic criterion ( number of individual in the household and legal relationship to the dwell ) , property-related criterion ( age of property , live area , number of dwelling in the property ) and regional criterion ( urban versus rural region ) . The data record be link for the period 2003 to 2010 and a forecast be make for 2011 . Time series be generate from this data for the specific us of power in private household .
