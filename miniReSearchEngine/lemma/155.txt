Every year , people write me in response to that article and in the past several week I have have an unusual number of inquiry , so we be re-running that 2003 article for those who might have miss it . Megawatts be basic to understanding electricity plan concept , but what be they ? News story cover electric generation topic often try to illustrate the worth of a megawatt in term of how many home a particular amount of generation could serve . A June 11 , 2003 Reuters ' article describing the potential sale of AEP 's Texas generation facility state that AEP be offer to sell 29 generate unit with a total net generation capacity of 4,497 megawatt , or roughly enough electricity to power 4.5 million average home . A May 21 , 2003 article in the San Diego Union Tribune describe an agreement with Sempra that involves 1,900 megawatt , enough to supply 1.9 million home . Such article give the impression that one megawatt be enough electricity to supply 1,000 home . Yet , occasionally , an article will illustrate a different conversion such a an April 17 , 2003 article by Environment News Service which state Tucson Electric Power expand it solar capacity to 2.4 megawatt , enough to power 420 home . So what really be a megawatt ( MW ) and how many home can one MW of generation really serve ? The Basics The answer start with understanding the basic definition of energy term . Watts ( W ) be the yardstick for measuring power . A one hundred watt light bulb , for example , be rat to consume one hundred watt of power when turn on . If such a light bulb be on for four hour it would consume a total of 400 watt-hour ( Wh ) of energy . Watts , therefore , measure instantaneous power while watt-hour measure the total amount of energy consume over a period of time . A megawatt ( MW ) be one million watt and a kilowatt ( kW ) be one thousand watt . Both term be commonly use in the power business when describe generation or load consumption . For instance , a 100 MW rat wind farm be capable of produce 100 MW during peak wind , but will produce much less than it rat amount when wind be light . As a result of these vary wind speed , over the course of a year a wind farm may only average 30 MW of power production . Similarly , a 1,000 MW coal plant may average 750 MW of production over the course of a year because the plant will shut down for maintenance from time-to-time and the plant operate at less than it rat capability when other power plant can produce power less expensively . The ratio of a power plant 's average production to it rat capability be know a capacity factor . In the previous example , the wind farm would have a 30 percent capacity factor ( 30 MW average production divide by 100 MW rat capability ) and the coal plant would have a 75 percent capacity factor ( 750 MW average divide by 1,000 MW rat capability ) . Load factor generally , on the other hand , be calculate by dividing the average load by the peak load over a certain period of time . If the residential load at a utility average 5,000 MW over the course of a year and the peak load be 10,000 MW , then the residential customer would be say to have a load factor of 50 percent ( 5,000 MW average divide by 10,000 MW peak ) . Knowing the peak and average demand of a power system be critical to proper plan . The power system must be design to serve the peak load , in this example 10,000 MW . But the actual load will vary . The load might be 10,000 MW at noon , but only 4,000 MW at midnight , when few appliance be operate . The capacity or load factor give utility planner a sense of this variation . A 40 percent load factor would indicate large variation occur in load , while a 90 percent load factor would indicate little variation . Residential home tend to have low load factor because people be home and use appliance only during certain hour of the day , while certain industrial customer will have very high load factor because they operate 24 hour a day , 7 day a week . Residential Electricity Consumption The amount of electricity consume by a typical residential household varies dramatically by region of the country . According to 2001 Energy Information Administration ( EIA ) data , New England residential customer consume the least amount of electricity , average 653 kilowatt hour ( kWh ) of load in a month , while the East South Central region , which include state such a Georgia and Alabama and Tennessee , consume nearly double that amount at 1,193 kWh per household . Census Division Number of Average Monthly State Consumers Consumption ( kWh ) New England 5,822,935 618 Middle Atlantic 15,045,495 641 East North Central 18,705,754 763 West North Central 8,287,837 903 South Atlantic 22,473,797 1,088 East South Central 7,356,975 1,193 West South Central 12,883,403 1,151 Mountain 7,368,280 847 West Coast 15,763,570 668 Hawaii & Alaska 609,661 642 U.S. Total 114,317,707 877 The large disparity in electric consumption be drive by many factor include the heavier use of air condition in the South . So it stand to reason that a one megawatt generator in the Northeast would be capable of serve about twice a many household a a generator locate in the South because household in the Northeast consume half the amount of electricity a those in the South . Going through the math , a 1,000 megawatt rat coal generator with a 75 percent capacity factor generate about 6.6 billion kWhs in a year , equivalent to the amount of power consume by about 900,000 home in the Northeast but only 460,000 home in the South . In other word , each megawatt of rat capacity for a coal plant in the Northeast generate the equivalent amount of electricity consume by 900 home in the Northeast but only about 460 home in the South . By comparison , a 30 percent capacity factor , 100 MW wind farm would generate the equivalent amount of power consume by about 35,000 home in the Northeast and 18,000 home in the South . In other word , each megawatt of rat capacity for a wind farm in the Northeast generate the equivalent amount of electricity consume by 350 home in the Northeast and 180 home in the South . So What be a Megawatt Worth ? The example demonstrate that there be two very important aspect to know what a MW of generation capacity be worth in term of how many equivalent home it represent . The first factor be how much electricity the power plant itself produce , which can be calculate by knowing the plant 's rating and capacity factor . Second , the location of the plant be very important a the amount of electricity consume in a typical household can vary dramatically across the country . The number use in the example be typical representation of coal and wind power plant . A low-cost coal plant typically operate at capacity factor of 60 percent or high . High quality wind sit will generate at about 30 to 40 percent of their rat capability on average because of wind speed variation . Solar generator average even less production , typically few than 25 percent capacity factor , because the generator do not produce electricity during the nighttime or during cloudy day . The commonly used one MW of generation equates to 1,000 home be a myth that likely originate year ago when household be small and air condition be n't as common . For conventional generator , such a a coal plant , a megawatt of capacity will produce electricity that equate to about the same amount of electricity consume by 400 to 900 home in a year . For renewable energy such a wind or solar , the equivalent be even less because they typically produce less energy than conventional generator since their fuel source be intermittent . Of course , no one generator be normally consider sufficient by itself to supply an individual customer . All generator must be take out of service for maintenance and some type of generator , such a nuclear , wind , and solar , be not normally able to follow change in load . For these reason power system require the use of backup generation source and occasionally electric energy storage , such a battery , to ensure the amount of power generate always match the load demand , every second .

Assume the average house in Colorado consume 8,000 kWh ( 8 MWh ) of electricity in a year . At 162 megawatt , the new Colorado Green wind farm will be the third-largest in the nation and will produce enough electricity each year to meet the need of roughly 75,000 home . June 16 , 2003 , Pueblo Chieftain . Hint : Let 's check the previously reference statement in the June 11 , 2003 Reuters ' article concerning AEP 's Texas generator : 29 generate unit with a total net generation capacity of 4,497 megawatt , or roughly enough electricity to power 4.5 million average home . According to EIA data , in Texas the average household consumes about 14,000 kWh ( 14 MWh ) in a year . If 4,497 MW of generation be truly to serve the equivalent of 4.5 million home , then the generation fleet would need to operate at an average capacity factor of 160 percent , which be not possible . The calculation go as follow : First calculate the total residential load for a year . This be do by multiplying 14 MWh per household by 4.5 million home for a total of 63 million MWhs . Next calculate the maximum amount of generation that could be produce from the generator in a year . Here it be assume the generator will operate at their rat capability ( 4,497 MW ) during all hour of a year ( 8760 hour ) . Multiplying 4,497 MW by 8760 hour give 39.4 million MWhs of generation capability in year . In other word , if the generator operate at a 100 percent capacity factor they would generate 39.4 million MWhs in a year . Now divide 63 million MWhs by 39.4 million MWhs to calculate a capacity factor of 1.6 or 160 percent . This be another way to calculate capacity factor , by taking the total generation production over a year and divide by it maximum potential generation production in a year . In this case we divide 63 million MWhs-the total generation production need in a year to serve the 4.5 million homes-by 39.4 million MWhs-the theoretical maximum production from 4,495 MW of generation - result in a 160 percent capacity factor , which be not possible to achieve . Clearly , 4,497 MW of generation will not serve 4.5 million household in Texas . In fact , in practice , 4,497 MW of generation will produce substantially less that 39.4 million MWhs in a year because no generation unit will operate at 100 percent of their rat value year round .
