By Laura Barron-Lopez Facebook Twitter Email Comments PRINT SEND PDF The electric bill in January 2011 be $ 150.23 , the usual cost of the monthly bill and typical for this small Laguna Woods home . One year late , the bill be $ 514.34 . What could have possibly cause this $ 364 increase a leap of 243 percent ? A new state-of-the art Jacuzzi ? Millions of holiday light to rival Disneyland ? No , Pat Wiseman say . The only change to his parent ' home be a new smart meter from the electric company , Southern California Edison . It have be instal at the end of October . Smart meter be part of the new Edison SmartConnect grid . They connect to a secure wireless network that SCE say give customer great control to manage their usage even from a cellphone , many mile from home . Smart meter be also read remotely , so employee do n't have to trek to the house to read the meter . By the end of this year , 5 million smart meter be slat to be instal in Southern California . SCE be almost do instal them in Orange County but there may soon be a way to opt out ( at a price ) . It be after his mother 's smart meter be instal that Wiseman start see problem . Between Nov. 10 and Dec. 13 , the usage for the 1,600 square-foot home be 62.4 kilowatt hour , he say . Between Dec. 13 and Jan. 12 , it be 102.1 kilowatt hour . Wiseman argues that there 's no reason the consumption should have change , because his mother 's habit do not . She live alone , spends most of her time in her bed , and have one 24- hour care person with her . He lay the blame for the astound increase squarely on the new meter . [ caption id= '' attachment_152485 '' align= '' alignleft '' width= '' 300 '' caption= '' Edisons SmartConnect campaign show a cheerful consumer . '' ] [ /caption ] When we first speak to SCE , a spokesman say there be no way of tell if there be accuracy problem without examine the individual usage of the consumer . But the company say it have not have complaint about accuracy . Instead , he say , consumer say the new meter improve their ability to track their usage . However , since December of 2008 , the California Public Utilities Commission have receive 946 complaint on SCE 's smart meter , range from concern over health danger to privacy and bill issue , to simply not want the smart meter at all . The health issue people complain about include dizziness , nausea and headache symptom some say be cause by the radio frequency ( RF ) radiation that the smart meter emit a well a worry about be expose to possible carcinogen . SCE have compare the strength of smart meter ' RF signal to other household device , and say that a cellphone next to your ear emits a signal that 's tremendously strong than a smart meter three foot away ( the cellphone signal be 4,960 microwatts per-centimeter-squared high than the smart meter 's , to be exact ) . Due to the complaint and various citizen action group ban together against smart meter , the state Public Utilities Commission will consider an opt-out proposal for consumer at it April 19 meeting . The proposal be put forward March 15 , and lay out the option on how to best institute an opt-out program , a well a the cost . Choosing to opt out will not be free of charge . The Public Utilities Commission's Division of Ratepayer Advocates and the Consumer Power Alliance be push for an analog meter opt-out option , because that 's what Pacific Gas and Electric Co . have to do for it customer in Northern California . > 1 2 Next Page Most popular Hoag and Fountain Valley hospital be favorite for birth tourism , Homeland Security off Updated : One dead , another hurt after move RV catch fire in Huntington Beach Can you taste the difference ?
