BERG Published : January 13 , 1991 IN a Jerusalem hotel some year ago I be feel particularly smug that I 'd have the foresight to buy an adapter so I could plug in the heat disinfect unit for my contact lens . My pride , how ever , turn to horror the next morning when I discover my lens have be char . Other traveler report similar nightmare -- computer that remain blank , hair dryer that smoke , electric toothbrush that whir at extraordinary speed . Considering all the potential pitfall with electrical appliance abroad , it 's no wonder some traveler steer clear of the issue entirely and either do without , or depend on hotel to supply hair dryer and iron . But many small inn and hotel do not stock small appliance . Moreover , many traveler prefer to carry their own appliance , particularly when they relate to personal hygiene . Such appliance range from curl iron to plaque-removing toothbrush to hand-held shaver and electric denture cleaner . To use these appliance abroad require some knowledge of electricity and , more important , the right plug and voltage converter . Three Primary Concerns Basically , the problem of use electrical appliance abroad can be reduce to three area : First , plug in the appliance . Because the configuration of wall receptacle differ around the world , you may have to use an adapter . The second concern be voltage -- the pressure under which current flow through an electrical system . Because most United States appliance be design to work at around 110 volt and because many power company abroad generate electricity at 220 volt or great , you need a device call a voltage converter to step down the current . Finally , there be the issue of how many time per second the alternating current in an electrical system change direction . In the United States , AC current change direction 60 time a second -- thus the phrase 60-cycle service . But in other part of the world , Europe be the best example , the current change direction only 50 time a second . And in some country , like India , the current be direct , which mean it do not alternate at all . While the slower , 50-cycle service be generally not a problem for small gadgetry , like a portable clothes steamer , a lot of electronic equipment , like laptop computer and video recorder , work only on 60 cycle and can be damage if supply with a different current . Fortunately , the equipment require to operate most small appliance safely be inexpensive , light and easy to use . Most luggage retailer , travel shop and department store carry adapter-plug kit . The open on one side of the adapter be design to accept the familiar rectangular , two-pronged plug find on most United States appliance . The other side have a different set of prong design to fit into a foreign wall outlet , assume the voltage be 110 . While wall-outlet opening be configure in dozen of way around the world , five configuration account for 95 percent of the outlet . The two-pronged United States system , for instance , be also use in Central America , the Caribbean , South America and Japan . American traveler really need to carry only four adapter plug : the plug that fit into the two round hole in continental Europe , the plug for Australia 's two rectangular hole ( unlike the American system , in which the opening be parallel , the opening in an Australian wall outlet form a `` V '' ) , the three-pronged plug for British bathroom and the plug with two oversized round prong for other British outlet . All this assume , of course , that electricity be be supply at around 110 volt , which in my case be not true . Although I be able to plug in my heating unit for the contact lenses , the unit get 220 volt of electricity , not 110 . While most of North and South America , the Caribbean and Japan have 110-volt electrical circuit , almost all European utility generate 220-volt electricity . Elsewhere , voltage can run as high a 260 volt . If you use an adapter plug without reduce the voltage , you be likely to smell a faint odor . It could be your appliance burn out . `` If you be in a high-voltage country , you need to protect that appliance from that high voltage , '' say Edward Crawford , the marketing director for Norelco 's travel product . `` You need something to step down the voltage . '' Unless your appliance can work on 110 volt and 220 volt -- some hair dryer and electric razor , for instance , have switch that allow the device to work on both -- you will need a separate voltage converter . A cigarette-pack-size device also sell in most travel shop and department store , the converter rely on current-resisting coil to step down voltage to 110 volt . Many converter be sell with a set of adapter plug . The one complicate factor be that there be two different type of voltage converter : one for appliance that consume a lot of power ( hair dryer , iron and coffee maker ) , the other for low-power appliance like radio and shaver . The rough cut-off point be 50 watt . If an appliance consume more than 50 watt , it be consider a high-power device ; few than 50 watt , low power . You can either buy separate converter or an all-in-one unit with a toggle switch . `` A combined unit give you a lot of flexibility , '' say Donald Schubert of the Savvy Traveler , a travel-products retailer in Chicago . 1 2 Next Page > Book Flights Book A Hotel Rent A Car Book A Cruise Book A Package Book An Activity Flight Hotel Packages Car Cruise Activities What type of package do you want ?
