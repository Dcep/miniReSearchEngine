Saving Energy , the Environment , and Money - Calculations by W.A . SteerPhD Back to content About ... This page be one of several on my site on the topic of domestic energy efficiency , and offer answer to popular energy dilemas . Unlike less scientifically-based site , I include the reasoning , experiment and calculation to verify my claim . I intend to add to this page a and when I have the inspiration , and in response to question submit by the email use the address at the foot of this page . Another page ( shortly to be write ) will cover some general principle include that gas be usually cheap and more environmentally sound than electricity for domestic heating application . Questions and summary answer Q . Is it good to make a cup of tea use an electric kettle or to boil the water on the hob ? Electric kettle - convenient , and a safe bet under most circumstance Gas hob - mostly good , do n't be afraid to use if more convenient ( e.g . you want the water in the saucepan anyway ) Electric hob - avoid ; there be cheap and more environmentally-sound way to make a cuppa ! Significance - you 'd create ten time a much CO 2 drive one mile in a typical car a you would boil half a litre of water in a kettle ! The jug-kettle us only one third a much electricity a a saucepan on an electric hob , and so will also produce only one third the amount of CO 2 , and cost one-third a much . Comparisons to a gas hob be less clear cut . Although the gas hob still use around three time the amount of energy at the point of use , the balence of CO 2 emission be very sensitive to the electricity generate mix . Using the 2003 figure for UK electricity place the gas hob at only 15 % more CO 2 than the kettle , a fairly negligible difference . In monetary term , boil water on a gas hob will cost much the a the electric kettle , because ( in the UK ) gas be so much cheap than electricity per kWh . In the kettle the fully-immersed element couple heat into the water with very high efficiency and boil the water speedily so there 's little time for the kettle a a whole to lose heat to the room . Hob-methods couple the heat far less effectively to the water in the first place , and typically take much longer , result in great heat loss . Kettle experiment and calculation Note : no `` eco-kettle '' can use much less energy than any cheap plastic jug kettle to boil the same amount of water . You can only really save money and energy by taking care to not boil more water than you need . Q . `` If every household [ in the USA ] replace just three 60-watt incandescent light bulb with CFLs [ low-energy compact-fluorescents ] , we would reduce a much pollution a if we take 3.5 million car off the road ! `` , claim the US Environmental Defense organisation . Is that realistic ? If you assume the three bulb swap across 100 million household be use for around six hour per day , then the saving be comparable to fuel use by 3.5 million typical US car . Significance - each household could make similar saving by cutting their own car-use by just 1.2 mile per day . Calculations : CFL lamp saving comparison to car Typical energy use pattern in the UK Ofgem ( the energy regulator ) be widely quote state that the average UK household consume 3300 kWh electricity and 20500 kWh of gas annually . [ Although I have n't yet find a definite source , apparently these figure date from 1999 . ] Figures for 2003 put the average electricity figure at the rather high value of 4600 kWh . Source for recent UK gas and electricty consumption figure ( include regional breakdown ) : http : //www.dti.gov.uk/files/file20328.pdf British car be usually reckon to have a typical annual mileage of 10000 mile . 4600 kWh electricity 2500 kg CO 2 680 kg carbon 20500 kWh gas 3900 kg CO 2 1060 kg carbon 10000 car mile 2900 kg CO 2 790 kg carbon Note : to convert kgCO 2 to kg carbon , multiply by ( 3/11 ) [ molecular weight CO2 be 12+ ( 162 ) =44 , atomic weight of carbon be 12 . 12/44 be equivalent to 3/11 . ] [ Annual figure for USA car , 12500 mile , 21.5mpg , 5000 kg CO 2 ] Examples from my house Modest 3-bed terrace ( build in 1980 ) in the south of England , double-glazed , 3 occupant . Gas central heating/hot water , gas cooker , electric shower . Electric washing machine , no tumble dryer . Appliances probably UK-typical and about 5 year old . Household electricity consumption ( July 05 - July 06 ) : 2400 kWh Household gas consumption ( July 05 - July 06 ) : 11700 kWh Car mile : very few . I do n't own a car , cycle/walk daily to work , use train for long journey Tall larder fridge ( 250 litre ) , `` energy efficiency class B '' rat at 226 kWh/year Tall upright freezer ( 181 litre ) , `` energy efficiency class C '' rat 418 kWh/year Kettle usage estimate at 160kWh/year Combined TV/satellite box standby power c.20watts , 175kWh/year From a purely technical perspective ( and I firmly believe technical problem need technical solution , not just political rhetoric ) , the easy way to make the big saving in energy cost ( i.e . money ) and CO 2 be : Reduce the extent and temperature of heating in the house - turn down the thermostat , use timeswitches to not heat the house when it be unoccupied , turn down the heating in rarely-used room Avoid using electricity for heating ( house/hot-water/oven etc ) - for the same amount of heat , gas be around one third the price and produce 60 % less CO 2 . Reduce car journey and/or use a small more fuel-efficient vehicle - walking/cycling will also warm you from within , allow you to feel comfortable in building which be less extravagently heat Do n't use a tumble-dryer - dry clothes outside or in an unheated outhouse with good airflow . It take a lot of energy to evaporate water ! It 's also nice to recycle aluminium ( cans/foil/trays/lids/ ... ) , a aluminium manufacture be extremely energy intensive ; it requires 16kWh of electricity to refine 1kg of virgin aluminium . Put another way , make new aluminium for a single 20g drinks-can us a much electricity a run a conventional 40W bulb for 8 hour . Recyling aluminium us only 5 % a much energy . Source for aluminium energy 16kWh/kg : http : //www.world-aluminium.org/production/smelting/index.html CO 2 emission figure Standardised CO 2 emission figure for common fuel be publish by the British government , and these be the official factor for British business to use when make any environmental claim . For electricity the amount of CO 2 emit per kilowatt-hour ( kWh ) of electricity depends heavily on the method of generation ; nuclear should be zero ( or a bit more than zero if you take into account consequential emission - fuel mining/purifying/concentration/transport - and power station construction and demolition ) , coal will produce a lot of CO 2 , and gas somewhat less . Consequently the official figure for electricity be a weight average taking into account the mix of type of generate station which provide electricity to the UK . Key figure I 'll be use here be : Electricity 0.43 kg CO 2 per kWh [ 0.54 kg CO 2 per kWh * ] Natural Gas 0.19 kg CO 2 per kWh Coal 0.32 kg CO 2 per kWh Petrol ( gasoline ) 0.24 kg CO 2 per kWh 2.30 kg CO 2 per litre 0.30 kg CO 2 per mile , in a typical car Diesel fuel 0.25 kg CO 2 per kWh 2.63 kg CO 2 per litre * The standardise figure of 0.43 kgCO 2 /kWh should be use to allow year-on-year comparison until 2010 . However , a nuclear station become decommisioned and the fuel mix change the actual CO 2 estimation varies slightly from year to year . The most recent official estimate , for the year 2003 mix , be 0.54 kgCO 2 /kWh for electricity .

Calculations and reason Electric kettle v boil water on the hob As an experiment I try different way of boil 0.5 litre of water ( measure use a small measure jug ) . N.B . 1kWh=3600kJ ( because by definition 1 Watt be 1 Joule per second , and there be 3600 second in an hour ) . Plastic electric jug-kettle ( 2200W rating ) Time to boil : 1m40s ( 100 second ) Energy use : 100s2200J/s = 220000J = 220kJ 220kJ / 3600kJ/kWh = 0.061 kWh . Using 0.54 kgCO 2 /kWh give 33 gramme CO 2 Small-sized electric hob at full power ( 1200W rating ) In medium/small aluminium saucepan weigh 0.374kg Time to boil : 9m00s ( 540 second ) for vigorous boil [ 8m00s for begin to boil ] Energy use : 540s1200J/s = 648000J = 648kJ 648kJ / 3600kJ/kWh = 0.180 kWh . Using 0.54 kgCO 2 /kWh give 97 gramme CO 2 Medium-sized gas hob burner at full power ( 2000W rating ) In medium/small non-stick aluminium saucepan weigh 0.337kg Time to boil : 6m00s ( 360 second ) for a decent roll boil [ 5m20s for lazy bubbling boil ] Energy use : 360s2000J/s = 720000 = 720kJ 720kJ / 3600kJ/kWh = 0.200 kWh . Using 0.19 kgCO 2 /kWh give 38 gramme CO 2 The electric hob be easily the bad option , cost three time as much energy and CO 2 a the kettle . Although the gas hob still result in almost three time as much energy ( heat ) be deliver to the home , this come at very little extra CO 2 cost . If that warmth be useful to you , then why not ? On the other hand , because the hob
