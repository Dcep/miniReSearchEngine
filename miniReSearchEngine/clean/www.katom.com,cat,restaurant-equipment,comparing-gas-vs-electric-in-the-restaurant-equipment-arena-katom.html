Choosing Between Gas and Electric Restaurant Equipment
Gas Cooking Equipment Wins on Price, but Electric Units Can Bring the Heat
For countless years, one of the major debates among those in the food service industry has been over gas-fired versus electric
restaurant equipment
. While gas has traditionally been the winner of that struggle, as evidenced by how many restaurants opt to use it, electric has some die-hard adherents who are willing to stand up for their source.
Though gas is a foregone conclusion for many because of the benefits it provides, there are plenty of pros for electric heat. With most cooking equipment available in models that accept both heat sources, the debate is now far beyond whether you want a gas stove or an electric stove. Thats why we present these lists of benefits to each type of power source, but first 
Electric Rates vs. Natural Gas Prices
One of the major reasons gas has been more popular in commercial kitchens is that its typically cheaper than electricity when you compare how many BTU each can produce. For natural gas, that means about 1.03 million BTU per thousand cubic feet, while a kilowatt hour of electricity is capable of producing 3,412 BTU. A gallon of the less popular propane, most commonly sold as LPG in America, has 91,000 BTU potential. So, to compare apples to apples, we need to understand that 301 kilowatt hours, 11.3 gallons of propane, and a thousand cubic feet of gas are equal in terms of heating power.
According to U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) data from April 2013, the national average price
1
of a thousand cubic feet of natural gas was $10.44. The price has generally trended downward
2
in recent years, with a few peaks in high-demand years, as exploration and production have increased supply.
Propane, which is used by restaurant equipment noted as LP, has also experienced price stabilization and decreases as speculators have decoupled its value from that of crude oil. For March 2013, the price of propane
3
in the United States averaged $2.49 per gallon.
The EIA also reports the national average for electricity in April 2013 was about 10 cents per kilowatt hour for commercial customers. The price of electricity
4
has been pretty steady in most areas, though rates have steadily increased as new environmental regulations and other factors have boosted the costs of production.  EIA data indicates the national annual average retail price of a kilowatt hour
5
of electricity for commercial customers went from 8.03 cents in 2003 to 10.12 in 2012.
Using the equivalent measures of a thousand cubic feet of gas to 11.3 gallons of propane to 301 kilowatt hours, the average cost for electricity at 10 cents per kilowatt hour would be just under $30 for the same BTU as $10.44 worth of natural gas would provide. Propanes rate would be about $28 for the same amount of heating.
The difference between electric and natural gas costs may not be enough to convince a home chef to switch from an electric stove to a more expensive gas stove and pay for gas lines to be run to his or her home. After all, how many million BTU does the average home chef use in a month? However, that comparison shows a huge difference for a commercial kitchen.
Having said that, lets look at where electric restaurant equipment comes out ahead.
Benefits of Electricity in Commercial Cooking Equipment
The equipment is typically cheaper and easier to install, since it mostly involves putting a plug into a socket.
Electric is generally more efficient than gas, since all the energy coming in is converted directly into heat. With gas, some of the vapor is lost.
Electric ovens tend to cook more evenly than gas-fired ones.
Theres some debate about this, but theres ample research to suggest theres less heat escape during operation from electric sources, which should mean a cooler kitchen and lower HVAC bills.
Unlike with gas, theres essentially no danger youll have an electricity leak that could put noxious fumes into your kitchen and dining area.
Advantages of Gas-Fired Restaurant Equipment
The knob directly controls the flow of gas and, thus, the intensity of the flame, you have more precise control over how hot each eye is. That should yield easier and better cooking.
With gas, the flame lights immediately and begins producing heat, which means theres no waiting for an element to heat up as with electric cooking equipment.
A power outage is typically no trouble for gas appliances, so you can keep serving when electricity-based kitchens are shut down.
Since the flame goes out immediately when the control is turned to Off, these units cool down more quickly than electric units. That means less ambient heat produced during idle periods.
Thanks to the way the more spread-out heat from the flame moves, gas restaurant equipment heats the bottoms and sides of pans. That means it works faster and more efficiently.
