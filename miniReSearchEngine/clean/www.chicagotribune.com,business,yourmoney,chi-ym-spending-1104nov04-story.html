Extending life of razor blades leaves users dry

Some everyday purchases seem to tick off consumers more than others.  Gasoline and inkjet cartridges are examples. Another is razor blades.
The razor industry is known for a marketing strategy in which the seller  takes a loss on the device, the razor handle, and makes money on refills, the  blades. That model is used by inkjet printers and cartridges, video-game  consoles and games and mobile phones and wireless service, among others.
The razor industry has undergone an amazing run of one-upsmanship.  Two-blade razors were bettered by the introduction of three-blade cartridges  by Gillette, then four-blade cartridges by Schick, then five-blade razors with  lubricating strips, some with vibrating handles, from Gillette. Each is touted  to give a closer, more comfortable shave than the last.
Whether you are shaving your face or your legs, you could be paying several  dollars each for these multiple-blade cartridge refills. To save money, you  could buy cheaper blades, but many consumers claim the more expensive new  razors are, indeed, superior. So the other way to spend less is to make the  blades last longer.
How can consumers make razor blades last longer? There are many proposed  methods. But Gillette and Schick declined to allow interviews with executives  or blade-research personnel to discuss them.
The most a Gillette spokeswoman would say by e-mail is that "Gillette  scientists have not seen any data to substantiate" methods of making blades  last longer. Schick would not comment at all.

I have been shaving with the same razor blade for 9 months before changing razor blades. After shaving, I completely rinse off the blade to insure there are no facial hairs or shaving cream on the blade or razor and then dry it on a towel. I then store the razor in a container of mineral oil...

Granted, some proposed ways of extending blade life seem far-fetched or  impractical for everyday consumers.
They include cryogenically freezing blades, coating or submerging blades in  various oils or rubbing alcohol, storing blades in a magnetic holder to avoid  warping or placing your razor in a prism to somehow take advantage of the  earth's magnetic properties.
But one very simple method has great allure and at least anecdotal support:  dry your razor blades after shaving.
The concept is this: Razor blade dullness stems more from oxidation,  microscopic rusting, than from contact with whiskers. Water that sits on  blades between shaves causes the oxidation.
Corrosion can cause metal on the blade to flake off and the edge to become  blunted and jagged. That results in blades pulling and tearing hairs instead  of cleanly slicing through them.
Degraded performance prompts most people to ditch the blade for a new one.
If water causes rusting, and rusting is the main culprit of blade dullness,  then, presumably, drying your razor blades could increase the life of blades.  A high-profile test of this happened when consumer-advocate radio host Clark  Howard of Atlanta used a 17-cent disposable razor for an entire year. He said  he extended blade life by blotting his razor dry with a towel after use.
Howard's report intrigued Atlanta resident Brian Cohn, who then tried it  himself. Cohn said his results weren't quite as good but still amazing.  Instead of blades lasting the usual 10 days to two weeks, his blades lasted  five to six months.
"I just couldn't get over it," he said. "I truly hated buying razor  blades."
Cohn has since invented a razor-storage device with a small fan for drying  razors. He hopes to market it under the name RazorPro.
Because the only evidence he had was anecdotal, he paid for testing  research from an independent laboratory, 360-Degree Testing Service of  Yonkers, N.Y. It tested a two-blade razor from Bic, a three-blade razor from  Gillette and a four-blade razor from Schick.
The results? Using the fan device to dry blades extended blade life an  average of 122 percent, or more than double.
None of this is conclusive proof that drying your blades after shaving will  make them last longer. But it's worth a try, especially if you use expensive  cartridges. If it doesn't work for you, you've lost very little.
Other ideas for reducing shaving expenses are to buy cheaper disposable  razors, use an electric razor or use coupons for name-brand cartridges.
Or you could shave less. Men can grow a beard, for example. For women,  well, letting hair grow is an individual choice.

Sharp solutions
These ideas, used individually or together, are free:
Shake it up. With a loose wrist, shake the razor vigorously for several  seconds to dislodge water droplets from blades. Or tap the razor handle on the  edge of the sink.
Towel it off. Blot, don't rub, the blade cartridge on a towel or dry  washcloth.
Blow it dry. Use a hair dryer or fan to dry blades of the razor. Don't blow  dry razors too long or you might end up spending more on electricity than you  save on razor blades. About 10 seconds should suffice.
Put it away. Store your razor outside the bathroom to avoid steam and  humidity from showers getting to blades. Or store the dry razor in a  resealable plastic bag.
Soften hair. To the extent that wear results from contact with whiskers  instead of oxidation, shave only after softening hair with a moisturizing  soap. After applying shave cream or gel, don't shave right away. Allow time  for hair to soften further.
