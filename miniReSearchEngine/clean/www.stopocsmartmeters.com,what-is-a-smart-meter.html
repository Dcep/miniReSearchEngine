chip (manufactured in China).
The Electric Company
Currently, SCE is in the process of removing all fully functional existing electromechanical analog meters (with 30 year life spans) to computerized wireless Smart Meters. Our current analog meters operate without electricity continuously measuring the usage in our homes. The usage is displayed on the meter, read by an SCE employee and billed by the number of watts used.
Replacing the traditional meter is the new "Smart Meter" that has a 15 to 20 year life span and, contrary to analog meters, require electricity to function. SCE employees will no longer come to your home to read the meter as all electric usage will be collected and transmitted wirelessly back to SCE through
pulsed
Radio Frequency (RF)
on a
continuous 24/7 basis
.
Note: SCE literature claim that the Smart Meters pulse frequency is 45 seconds per day. However, because these meters need to continuously communicate with each other, called chatter, the
pulsed radiation is virtually constant and at the same RF level as the data transmission radiation level.
Itron OpenWay CENTRON Smart Meter
(used by SCE), "communicates to utility systems allowing them to leverage applications such as
time-of-use and peak pricing data, home networking and demand response
." Some of the features:
ZigBee
2.4 GHz
radio
transceiver (WiFi),
900 MHz radio (cellular)
microprocessor
for application and communication processing and
high speed
hardware trace
probe.
Using
ZigBee
firmware, the Smart Meter collects details of energy consumption every 15 minutes and
transmits the data via wireless (RF) Cell Relay signals back to the SCE Collection Engine
.
The Gas Company
OpenWay Gas Module
(
Southern California Gas
) uses 2.4GHz ZigBee wireless networking for combination gas and electric utilities. Installations are planned to begin in late
2012 through 2017
and cost customers approximately $2.00 per month (just for the new meter). Below are it's features:
Remote disconnect, reconnect and service-limiting switch
Demand response
Critical peak pricing and time-of-use rate
updates
Remote
device configuration for endpoint
program updates
Remote
firmware updates
using ZigBee and gas firmare
Can be read by OpenWay CENTRON meters without need for additional infrastructure
Continually stores and updates the last 40 days of hourly interval data
Operates in bubble-up mode and does not require an FCC license
The Water Company
Local
water departments
will also be replacing the current meters with RF controlled meters that will communicate wirelessly with the Smart Meter attached to your home.
Some residents have raised concerns
about the health effects from the frequencies.
The first Zigbee radio transmitter creates a home WiFi (2.45 GHz) to communicate with appliances and other 'Smart' devices.
The second Zigbee radio transmitter communicates via cellular service (900 MHz) back to the utility.
What is the Smart Grid?
The Smart Grid is a wireless communication infrastructure  which, currently, has two functions: control of services and  billing. Because it collects real-time electricity, gas and water  usage details, rates can vary during the day (aka Time of Use or TOU  rates). The utility monitors and controls when and where their services  are provided. The benign meters of the past that merely collected  monthly kilowatts used are gone.
Touted as way for customers to "save money",
Southern California Edison plans on spending
$5 BILLION
for the Smart Grid
.
Smart Grid does
NOT
:
Fix the aging power grid.
Repair power plants or add capacity.
Improve the way we transmit electricity over power lines.
Deliver any benefit to the customer.
Smart Grid is taxpayer-paid revenue system that will:
Increase
price
of electricity to ratepayers.
Ration services with punitive pricing structure and remote off switch.
Create the
Internet of Things
infrastructure for the benefit of third party vendors such as
Cisco, Intel, Microsoft, Google, IBM, etc.
Collect
Big Data
for government, NSA, police, insurance companies, etc.
Blanket neighborhoods with a
Class 2B Possible Carcinogen on the level with lead, DDT and chloroform
.
Create millions of
hackable
wireless data points with insufficient cyber security.
Catch fire
as the units are not UL approved.
Could the Smart Grid create a new currency using Carbon Credits to restrict utility services under California's Cap and Trade requirements?
Will energy become the new money to be restricted and traded as is done with Smart Coin Meters
?
Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI)
Internet of Things (IOT) - Smart Grid Mesh Network
WiFi networks work by connecting antenna-controlled devices within a network and allowing such devices to communicate among  each  other.
The Smart Grid Mesh Network takes the WiFi and cellular network concept and expands it exponentially using millions of Smart Meter endpoints, pole-mounted routers, relays, range extenders to create large-scale WiFi network over a broad area like a city.
Note: For every 500 or so homes, a toxic
Collector Smart Meter
is installed which works to communicate data back to pole-mounted routers. You do
NOT
want one of these forced on your home.
Towns such as Santa Clara, California have (blanketed the area with microwave radiation and) created Smart Meter Mesh Network for their entire city through the utility-based Smart Meters
.
"We  are the first utility  in the nation to  offer free Wi-Fi as part of  the smart meter rollout,"  said Larry Owens,  a manager with Silicon  Valley Power, Santa Clara's  municipal power  company.
This WiFi cannot be shut off.
When there is WiFi everywhere, items that are chipped can be monitored and tracked. Smart Meters contain Zigbee radio chips which communicate with  Zigbee-chipped
appliances such as refrigerator, washer,  dryer, pool  equipment, toaster oven, hair dryer, hot water heater,  security system,  and lights.

How the Smart Grid Works
Itron's Smart Grid
It is the plan of power and energy authorities worldwide to replace current disk-style (analog)
electric, gas and water meters with digital "Smart Meters.
" These are wireless devices (computers) that use
radiofrequency (RF)
waves to monitor use and transmit information about each household's consumption. They are being enthusiastically promoted by governments and industry as a "green initiative," supposedly enabling utility companies to efficiently monitor consumption during peak and "down" times, and encourage wise use of energy and resources.The vision is that these "Smart Meters" will
operate within a wider ranging "Smart Grid."
The information-carrying radio waves,
transmitting (continuously) 24/7
, will effectively
blanket homes and neighborhoods with (WIFI) RF radiation
that could adversely affect not just humans, but all living systems. In particular, these meters have the potential to affect not only
electro-hypersensitive persons, but
children and pregnant women, persons with medical conditions such as heart arrhythmia, those with compromised immune systems, and others who rely on medical and/or metal implants or equipment.
In addition to health concerns, Smart Meters bring with them questions about (privacy, security, pricing) fire and security hazards.
The costs of installing the new digital wireless meters is substantial, their accuracy is debatable, and there is much controversy as to whether or not the readings serve to decrease power use, or simply to increase power costs to consumers.
Serious disagreement continues between the electric utility companies and thousands of private homeowners who refuse the
forced installation of Wireless Smart Meters on their homes without consent
. Customers want the Utilities to listen to their valid concerns before pressing ahead with this program.

SCE received  $79,000,000 to build a Smart Grid
in the City of  Irvine to literally
provide a living laboratory with Smart Grid  technology
.
Siting and Easement Rights Violated
SCE is in violation of their utility easement. The company is not allowed to install a device which interferes with the homeowner's health, privacy and safety.
SCE does not have an easement to
install wireless telecommunications facility and violate personal property siting rights
on the premises of a homeowner without their express permission and that of the local governing officials.
An easement is a clause in your contract with your utility which  allows them access to their equipment, for meter-reading and  maintenance. Check with your house deed to see if that is part of the  contract. Your utility may also have the information about the  particulars of their easement.
But many people have called into question whether installation of the smart meterwhich
includes telecommunications equipment
and marks an unprecedented change in metering, blanketing your home in a  class 2B carcinogenactually qualifies as maintenance!

Independent Evaluation
According to a
July 2010 Evaluation of Residential Smart Meter Policies
(pdf), the Smart Meter has approximately 30 separate functionalities. Most of these functionalities
will primarily benefit the utility
unless expressly employed toward end-consumer programmes with the support of regulation and supportive market structures."
The CPUC and the utilities have developed an integrated package of smart metering plus
demand response measures of direct load control and time differentiated pricing tariffs.
All of the utilities in California have now received permission to rollout smart meters as part of a larger efficiency plans  the main
demand response programmes in use are critical peak pricing, critical peak rebates, time of use and automated AC thermostats.
Customer feedback and education will also be used but sometimes as a support to the pricing programmes only.
On top of this, each utility has asked for extra funds to provide services which go beyond the minimal requirements of the smart metering regulation. There is good evidence that
private industry as well as the utilities now have a substantial financial stake in the success of these programmes
creating green jobs and business opportunities.
The positive cost/benefit for the utilities is directly related to how successful they are with their demand response programmes (due to the regulatory framework in place). The overall success of the meter rollout will now be dependent on the ability of the utilities and private companies involved to educate and interest consumers.
Rollout is due to be completed in 2012
for most utilities and the full impact of the programmes may take a couple of years after this to be fully realized.
