Energy saving kettles
Ways to save energy on your next cup of tea
If youre looking for energy saving kettles, you probably dont need to look much farther than your own kitchen. Some simple common sense will save you a lot more energy when boiling your water, than trying to track down a kettle thats more energy efficient.
Consider electric kettles. Remember that an electric heating element is 100% efficient at converting electrical energy to heat. You arent going to find one kettle with a heating element thats more efficient than another. There are of course a couple of features that can help you make more efficient use of a kettle. Cheaper kettles, for example, sometimes lack an automatic shutoff, which means that if you get sidetracked, your water keeps on boiling until the kettle boils dry (and possibly burns itself out). So a kettle with automatic shutoff will save you energy if you tend to leave the kettle boiling and then wander off.
Here are some of the key things you can do to turn ordinary kettles into energy saving kettles, without rushing off to the store to buy a new one:
Only boil what you need.
This is an obvious one: if youre making a four-cup pot of tea, only put four cups of water in the kettle. Theres no point boiling more water than you need. It will take longer, and it will use more energy. So measure carefully.
Of course, if your kettle doesnt let you see inside easily, measuring with a measuring cup (or by filling the teapot first, then pouring that into the kettle) may be your only option; since youre not likely to keep this up forever, buying a kettle where you can clearly see how full it is will help.

Buy the right size kettle.
This is really an add-on to boiling only what you need. If you usually only boil a cup or two at a time, get a really small kettle. Larger kettles have a minimum fill level required to cover up the heating element. If that minimum fill level is more than the hot water you need, youre better off switching to a smaller kettle than always boiling too much water.
The Breville kettle shown at right boils up to eight cups of water, with a minimum one cup setting. For people who tend to make a cup of tea at a time, but occasionally want a full pot, energy saving kettles like this one make more sense than a cheap, conventional kettle where you cant even tell how much water youve added. Also note that this kettle includes five different brewing temperatures so you only heat the water to the level you need. No point boiling water for coffee, if you want it brewed at a lower temperature.

Dont boil if you dont have to
. For making tea and coffee, you dont actually need to bring the kettle to a full boil. While its one of my perpetual gripes that most restaurants dont know how to make tea  they brew it with tepid water, which isnt hot enough to properly steep out the full flavor of the tea  boiling water is too hot for most teas, and for coffee as well. If you could set your kettle so that it only boiled the water to the temperature you need, there would be some savings there. For instance, taking water from 60F to 200F (the temperature recommended for French press coffee) is 140F, while boiling at 212F is an extra 12F more, or an extra 8%. For green teas, meanwhile, the recommended temperature is 175F, so theres a savings of about 24% on the energy required to heat water for green tea, instead of bringing it to a full boil.
The Cuisinart cordless electric kettle pictured above is a highly rated and somewhat less expensive kettle that does just this  lets you choose the type of tea youre making (theres a French Press option too) and then brings the water to that temperature, and beeps when its done. The only drawback to this kettle  its billed as a feature, but is not a feature in terms of its energy efficiency  is that it keeps the water at the selected temperature for up to half an hour, so that if you start the kettle and get temporarily sidetracked, the water is still ready when you get to it later. This is convenient but can lead to wasted energy if you make a habit out of leaving the kettle on unattended.
Prewarm the teapot sparingly, and reuse the water:
If you are boiling water for tea and you want to prewarm your teapot (a habit my parents insist on, though they never notice when I make their tea without preheating), just pour a half cup of boiling water in the pot, swirl it around for about 10 seconds or so, and pour it back in the kettle. Bring the kettle back to a boil and then make your tea. This way your tea pot is pre-warmed, but you havent thrown the hot water used for preheating the teapot down the drain.
Use the hot water right away.
Heres a sin Im guilty of, as are many others: I start the kettle boiling, then go off and do something else, meaning to get back to the kettle right after it has boiled, and brew my coffee. But I get sidetracked. The kettle boils, then shuts off. Ten minutes later Im back, and I have to boil the water again to brew my coffee, since the water is no longer hot enough. If youre heating your house with electricity, this doesnt matter so much  the heat from the kettle escapes into your house and warms it. But if you heat with a less expensive source like natural gas, or its already hot outside, its just a waste of energy to bring a kettle to the boil twice, when once will do.

Another thing you can do to ensure you use the hot water right away, is to make sure everything else is ready before the water boils. If youre making coffee the way I do (hand-pouring a thin trickle of hot water through a cloth filter, as I was tought by coffee connoisseurs in Costa Rica), have the ground coffee in the filter ready to pour, and the decanter waiting under the filter. Dont wait for the water to boil,
then
start setting up the coffee-making or tea-making ritual.
Finally, as far as using the hot water quickly goes, if you often tend to forget about the kettle, look for energy saving kettles that let you know when the water has boiled. Old whistling stovetop kettles definitely qualify as energy saving kettles when it comes to forgetful people: its pretty hard to leave one of them boiling for very long.

Look for insulated energy saving kettles.
If you are like me and you just cant help getting sidetracked after the kettle has boiled  and especially if you drink a lot of tea or coffee  look for energy saving kettles with an insulated shell. These kettles will keep more of the heat inside the kettle so that the water lasts longer before it needs to be boiled again, or takes less energy to come back to the boil.
For the avid tea drinker, consider an insulated electric kettle such as the Zojirushi series of hybrid water boilers. These are outstanding products that get rave reviews from buyers; they are energy efficient because the water is kept hot in a vacuum flask, and they provide three different temperature settings:
205F for ramen noodles and herbal infusions
195F for black teas
175F for green and white teas
The hottest setting can be used for coffee if youre brewing it by hand. The Zojirushi is definitely a pricy option but if you want the convenience of instant hot water for your tea youll love this line of boilers.
Save the extra hot water.
If you do boil too much hot water, use whats left. Leave it in the kettle  someone else might come along and want to make themselves a cup of tea. Or put the water in a thermos to keep it hot. Or pour it into the sink when youre doing dishes (naturally, you have the plug in already!). Above all, dont pour hot water down the drain in winter  youre just throwing away perfectly good heat.

Use an electric kettle, not a stovetop kettle.
An electric kettle will be more efficient than a kettle you put on a stovetop, because much of the heat from a stovetop burner escapes around the sides of the kettle, especially with a natural gas or propane stove. So using an electric kettle is better than using a stove-top kettle on an electric stove, and is probably more energy efficient than using a stove-top kettle on a gas stove as well.
In the case of a gas stove, an electric kettle could be
less
efficient in terms of both price and greenhouse gases produced, if your electricity comes from coal or natural gas, because only about a third of the heat from burning the fossil fuel at the power plant reaches your house as electricity, whereas over 60% of the heat in the natural gas or propane actually heats up the stove-top kettle. Of course, if you switch to a

, you wont produce any greenhouse gases at all by boiling your electric tea kettle.
Make one pot of tea and keep it hot.
No one likes to drink a cold cup of tea or coffee. But what do you do if the pot has gone cold? The easy way out is to boil the kettle again and make a fresh pot, but this can be wasteful. Some other options:
Reheat the cold cup of tea or coffee in the microwave. Sounds like sacrilege to some connoisseurs, but it does save energy! If you dont mind it, do it. No ones watching.
Make iced tea or coffee with whats left. Just throw it in the fridge and drink it cold later. Works for me  at least, in the summer!
Use a thermos for either tea or coffee. Tea can be brewed in a ceramic pot as usual, but as soon as it is brewed, pour the tea (without the tea bags or tea leaves) into a vacuum insulated decanter. This will keep it hot for hours without using any extra energy.
Dont boil if you dont need to.
If you need hot water but not boiling water, it doesnt make sense to boil the water and then let it cool down. Similarly, if you boiled the kettle a quarter hour earlier, and some hot water was left in it, you dont necessarily have to boil that water again  it may already be hot enough for whatever you want to use it for. Some newer energy saving kettles come with temperature controls that let you heat the water to a specified temperature below boiling, while others have a temperature indicator to tell you what the temperature is. If your kettle hot water temperature is at 90C, its probably hot enough to make another cup of tea or dissolve a cube of Oxo. No need to boil again.
Some like it hot!
What temperature should you steep your tea?
What temperature should you brew your coffee?
Black tea should be steeped at 195F (90C)
Green/white tea should be steeped at 175F (80C)
Hand-brewed coffee should be brewed at 195-205F (90C-95F).
Theres really not much more to energy saving kettles than this: boil only what you need, use it right away, keep it hot in a thermos without using more energy, and be at hand and at the ready when the kettle does boil. If you strive to do this, then all the kettles you come across will be energy saving kettles. And if youre looking for a new energy saving kettle, just buy one thats the right size, is electric, has an automatic shutoff, and, if you get easily sidetracked, reminds you loudly when the water has boiled!
A word about coffee makers
You can make your coffee as I do, by pouring near-boiling water into a cloth sack filled with ground coffee. Thats how they do it in Costa Rica, where I lived for a year, and it does make delicious coffee. Its reasonably efficient as long as you make sure, as with tea, to only boil the right amount of water.
But it may be more energy efficient to use a coffee maker, especially one with a thermal flask that keeps the brewed coffee warm without requiring a heating plate. Another alternative is to use a small coffee maker if you typically only drink a cup or two at a time. People often brew a huge pot of coffee, leave it on the warming plate, and then wind up throwing most of it out because its been cooked to death.
