With many great range options available, it can be overwhelming to even narrow the field to choosing between gas or electric, let alone tackling the daunting task of examining the particular models. Many people have strong opinions and swear by one or the other. In reality, they will both get the job done and each has its own strengths and weaknesses.

Professional cooks swear by the versatility of flame heat that you can quickly and accurately adjust. Mothers with toddlers on the other hand cant imagine purposely having an open flame anywhere near their home.
A major consideration for anyone purchasing a new kitchen range is cost. Overall,
electric ranges
are less expensive to manufacture making them less expensive to purchase. Cost will also be significantly less if your kitchen is pre-wired for an electric range. It can become costly if you have to have a gas line run into an existing property.
The time-honored debate rages on, but you can feel more confident making a choice with these helpful hints on your side. Once youve narrowed your choices to gas or electric, you will appreciate our reviews of
electric ranges
which will do the rest of the work for you. At TopTenREVIEWS We Do the Research So You Dont Have To.
Electric Ranges
Pros:
Less expensive to buy and install. Simply plug into the wall and youre ready to cook.
Easier to clean burners and surfaces.
Smooth-top electric ranges are more stable for pots and offer additional counter or storage space when not in use.
Instantly turns on and off every time with the twist of a knob versus gas ranges that may sputter to catch a flame, emitting unburned and potentially hazardous gas. No igniter or lighter necessary.
More functions, such as additional fans and grillers, are available than their gas counterparts.
More even heat distribution when baking.
Dry heat for optimal oven roasting conditions.
Cons:
Youll miss out on the smores!
Slower to cool when a burner is turned down or off.
Subject to power outages.
Gas Ranges
Pros:
More even stove top heat for cooking.
Easy to gauge and precisely adjust the level of heat by altering the flame.
Natural gas is inexpensive, abundantly available and clean burning.
Natural gas ranges are less expensive to operate than electric ranges.
The heat from a gas flame heats the sides, as well as the bottom, of pans, cooking food faster.
Able to change temperature rapidly. You can immediately remove the heat when the flame is turned off, so you can still leave food on the stove to rest without continuing to cook.
Less ambient heat to the rest of the kitchen.
Cons:
More expensive to buy and install.
More dangerous. Increased potential for gas leaks, the leading cause of residential fires. If a gas line is damaged or a pot boils over and quenches the flame, a home can quickly fill with toxic, flammable gas. Children or pets are also at greater risk to be burned or catch fire with an open flame.
Diminished Baking Results. Oven temps are hotter at the top so baking requires rotation and placement farther from heat source. Gas gives off moisture when cooking, creating a humid heat rather than the dry heat required for effective roasting.
