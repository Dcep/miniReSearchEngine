Gtech AirRam
Lose the cord. Not the performance.
The cord that gets snagged and holds you back. Gone. The heavy weight that makes it so hard to lift and carry. Halved*. The dust cloud when you empty the cylinder. History.
Weve designed the AirRam to take everything you hate about vacuuming and make it disappear.
Nick Grey  Inventor, Owner of Gtech.

"Is this the best vacuum cleaner ever?"
The AirRam provides exceptional cleaning performance. AirRam not only outperforms a number of cordless products with ease, but matches the performance of mains powered upright vacuums.*

Gtech AirRam - High performance cordless vacuum cleaner
The Gtech AirRam allows you to lose the cord, but keep the performance of mains powered upright vacuums.* Change the way you clean your home forever  faster, easier and more convenient.
High performance
AirRam is a cordless vacuum cleaner that is specially designed for floor cleaning, with proven performance on both carpet and hard-floors. It's highly efficient design means you enjoy the cleaning performance of mains upright vacuums, without the cord.*
AirRams edge cleaning technology helps you get into those awkward corners.
Powerful rotating brush bars also make it ideal for pet hair. The lightweight AirRam vacuum cleaner not only picks up surface hair, but also does a great job of lifting troublesome embedded hair from your carpet.
Moves easily
AirRams revolutionary, lightweight design allows you to glide around your home, steering easily from left to right. Move effortlessly from carpet to hard-floors and back again, with no settings to change.
AirRam has an ultra-low profile, allowing you to reach under chairs and tables.
AirRams cordless technology means no more fighting with snagged cords or plug sockets.
Lightweight
Thanks to its revolutionary design, which does away with so many bulky parts, AirRam weighs just 3.5kg. Thats half the weight of many mains powered upright vacuums, making AirRam easy to lift and carry up stairs.
Long run-time
AirRams power comes from a professional-grade 22V Lithium-ion battery.
Its energy efficient design means you can clean your home twice on one 4-hour charge, running for up to 40 minutes; a 1-hour short charge will deliver a burst of additional run time.
A 4-stage LED display indicates how much charge is left in the battery.
Cleaner emptying
Traditional vacuum cleaners suck the dirt either into a bag (which you have to replace) or into a cylinder (which create a messy dust cloud when emptying). AirRams technology compresses the dirt into bales that you just drop into the bin.
AirRam is fitted with lifetime washable filters, meaning that you dont need to purchase replacements.
2-year guarantee
If anything goes wrong with your AirRam over the next two years, as a result of faulty manufacturing, we will fix it or replace it.

Love my GTECH AIR RAM!!!
I've just gone back to work after having a baby, wanted a vacuum that would speed up my cleaning time as the one I have needed parts pulling apart to fit it in my cupboard so hated getting it out.

Makes REALLY light work of vaccuming...
I groan at the thought of whipping out the vac but with this gtech i dont have to rewind cables and go back to the wall socket and unplug the damn thing its just forwards, forwards, forwards which means the whole task can be achieved in less time than ever before.

Light and easy to use
Our old hoover is a bit big and heavy so we bought the Gtech., which is really light to tote around, up stairs etc. It picks up well and is really maneoverable. Ideal for a quick hoover rather than hauling out the mains machine and sorting out the cable etc. We have hardly used the old beast since getting th Gtech.

Gtech take cleaning to the next level
We took the opportunity to buy the combination GTech cleaner and the Multi. They have transformed the task of vacuum cleaning completely. There are no more moans concerning the lifting and bringing the heavy old machine from upstairs to downstairs or the cry to take the plug out while the machine went from room to room. The Gtech combo does all the things that the old machine did with a lot less effort on our part. We would highly recommend these products. 
Battery life is very good. The main cleaner lasts weeks not days, and the hand held Multi is on its second charge since purchase in December
