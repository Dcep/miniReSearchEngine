To get your question answered, email it to money@telegraph.co.uk with "household bills" in the subject line.
I am in the process of refitting my kitchen and have a choice between a gas or electric oven. Which is more cost-effective to run?
There are significant differences in the costs of cooking with gas and electricity, and given cooking accounts for a typical 4pc of the average 1,200 energy bill, it's worth making the right choice.
According to figures from the Energy Saving Trust, gas and electric ovens use the same amount of energy units, in the 200s of kWh per year, but the much higher price of electricity compared with gas makes electric ovens far more expensive to run.
On average, gas ovens cost around 9 a year to run, whereas electric ovens cost around 44 a year, so installing a gas oven gives you an annual saving of 35.

Experts have also warned that over the long-term, the cost of electricity will rise more quickly than that of gas because of the green taxes being added to the former.
Consumer Futures (formerly Consumer Focus), an official body which analyses the impact policy changes will have on consumers in regulated markets, recently published a
report on the issue.
It said households reliant on electric heating would see their typical bill rise by 282 by 2020. This was because the cost of energy efficiciency policies fall largely on electricity customers. Such initiatives include the Electricity Market Reform (EMR) - investment in the network - and Renewables Obligation, where households with solar panels and other energy generation devices are subsidised by other electricity customers. The schemes will have cost an estimated 4.8bn by 2020.
Consumer Futures called for intervention to protect the most vulnerable customers from unfair additional costs.
It's another reminder of why gas is wiser than electric when it comes to cooking costs.
There are other factors to consider. A microwave, for instance, can offer a cheaper way to cook than by oven, and sometimes cheaper than a hob.
Halogen ovens (pictured below) also make bold claims about the amount of energy they save. They can roast a chicken in 30 minutes and use 75pc less electricity than a conventional electric oven. When you combine this lower use of power with the 50pc faster cooking time, the savings could, in theory, be reasonable.
