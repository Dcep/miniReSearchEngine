.
Businesses looking to go solar will have slightly different considerations, which are outlined in our
Guide to Installing Solar PV for Business and Industry.

Step 2: Contact your electricity retailer
Not all electricity companies offer solar-friendly policies. Youll want to contact your electricity retailer to find out:
how solar will affect your current rates
what sort of
feed-in tariffs
they offer. A feed-in tariff is the amount an electricity retailer pays you for excess power generated by your solar panels.
Our
Guide to Installing Solar PV for Households
includes a list of questions to ask your electricity company.
Step 3: Find a solar PV retailer and plan your system
Its important to shop around when buying solar. Before you select a system, talk to different solar PV retailers about your options and obtain several quotes.
You also want to make sure that the company you buy your system from is ethical, reliable and will be there if something goes wrong. The best way to do this is by choosing a Clean Energy Council
Approved Solar Retailer
. Approved Solar Retailers follow industry best practice, use fully accredited installers and offer a minimum five-year guarantee on the entire system.

Step 4: Sign a contract
Once you have chosen your system and accepted a quote, your solar PV retailer, installer or designer will provide you with a contract.
There are a few things about the contract you should check before signing. Our
Guide to Installing Solar PV for Households
has all the details.
Step 5: Install your solar PV system
Your solar PV retailer or installer will install your system and provide you with all the necessary documentation.
Remember  to be eligible for government rebates, your system must be installed by a Clean Energy Council accredited installer.
An Approved Solar Retailer will always use accredited installers. If youre not buying from an approved retailer, ask to see your installers accreditation card or ensure they are listed on our

Your solar PV retailer will usually arrange for your solar system to be connected to the electricity network on your behalf.
Grid connection processes differ from state to state. Please refer to our
small-scale connection page
if you would like more information.
Step 7: Use and maintain your solar PV system
Congratulations! Your solar PV system is installed, and its time to start saving money on your power bills.
