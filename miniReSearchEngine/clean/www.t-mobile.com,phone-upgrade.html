Two years is too long to wait to upgrade your device. Thats why we offer JUMP!, a revolutionary upgrade program only from T-Mobile.
Upgrade your phone or tablet when the next hot device comes out or simply when youre ready for something new. Theres no waiting to upgrade or limits on how many times you can upgrade.
When youre ready to upgrade, simply trade in your eligible device and receive credit for all remaining device payments, up to half of its original cost. You are responsible for any remaining device payments at the time of upgrade.
Total peace of mind knowing that you can replace virtually any phone or tablet thats been damaged or lost through our premium device protection and mobile security features, included in JUMP!
Heres how JUMP! works
1. Buy a phone or tablet, get a Simple Choice plan, and finance your device through T-Mobile.
2. Enroll in JUMP! for $10/mo. when you buy your new device.
3. Upgrade anytime you want. Simply trade in your eligible device and T-Mobile will cover your remaining device payments up to half of your device cost.
And only with JUMP!, youre protected if your device is lost, damaged, or stolen with the included Premium Handset Protection and Lookout Mobile Security. (Deductible may apply; see FAQ below.)

JUMP! FAQ
How does JUMP! work?
JUMP!
TM
offers you freedom to upgrade your device when you want, not when youre told. Whenever youre ready to upgrade, simply trade in your eligible device and T-Mobile will pay off your remaining device payments, up to half of your device cost. Then purchase your new device on a new Equipment Installment Plan (EIP). JUMP! is also the only upgrade program from a major national carrier to offer you virtually complete protection for your device investment. Device protection and mobile security are included, for ultimate peace of mind. No more worrying about mechanical breakdown, accidental damage, loss, or theft. Youre covered with JUMP!.
What is the total cost of JUMP!?
JUMP! is $10 per month per device (plus taxes & fees), added to your monthly service and EIP costs. JUMP! includes Premium Handset Protection so youre covered against accidental damage, mechanical breakdown, loss and theft, as well as Lookout Mobile Security Premium. Standalone Premium Handset Protection purchased from T-Mobile without JUMP! would cost $8 per month and Lookout Mobile Security Premium would cost an additional $4 per month. When you upgrade or buy a new device on EIP, you also are subject to any down payments required. The monthly $10 JUMP! fee appears beginning with your first bill. Please note that if the device you wish to trade in is lost, stolen, or broken, you first will need to make a PHP claim and pay any necessary deductible or processing fee before redeeming your JUMP! upgrade.
Do I have to be on a specific rate plan to enroll in JUMP!?
Any customer on a qualifying Simple Choice rate plan, who financed a new phone or tablet within 14 days of purchase can enroll in JUMP! If youre an existing customer with other types of Value Plans you also may be eligible. Login to my.t-mobile.com for more details.
How does JUMP! work for tablets?
JUMP! is available for financed tablets and works the same as it does for handsets. Well pay for your remaining device payments, up to half of your original tablet cost when you trade in your eligible tablet.
Do I need to have a specific phone or tablet to qualify for JUMP!?
Any device financed through EIP is eligible for JUMP!. See
www.T-Mobile.com
for details.
Am I limited to specific types of devices when I upgrade?
You may upgrade to any device thats financed through EIP. However, you may not upgrade from a phone to a tablet or vise-versa.
Do I have to trade in my old phone  or tablet in order to upgrade through the JUMP! program?
Yes, if enrolled in JUMP!, you must trade in the same phone or tablet that you financed through EIP, and it must pass a three-point inspection: 1) powers on, 2) no cracked screen, and 3) no water damage. Should you experience any issue that would cause the device to fail initial inspection, you simply file a PHP claim and pay the deductible or any processing fee to replace it before redeeming a JUMP! upgrade. During the trade in, the IMEI number on the phone must match the IMEI number on the JUMP! account to be eligible.
What happens if I lose my phone or tablet or if it gets damaged before I can trade it in? Or what if it doesnt pass the 3-point inspection?
JUMP! includes Premium Handset Protection (PHP), which covers accidental damage, mechanical breakdown, loss, and theft, and provides a replacement phone up to two times in twelve months after the deductible or any processing fees are paid. If a device is damaged and does not pass the 3-point inspection at trade in, you must file a claim for the damaged device through PHP and pay the deductible or any processing fee to replace it before a trade-in for an upgrade can be initiated. However, this can be handled in one visit to a participating T-Mobile store. If you want to file a PHP claim but not process an upgrade, you can call the vendor directly without a store visit.
How often can I JUMP!?
There are no limitations on how many times you can upgrade with JUMP!. We want you to pick the frequency thats right for you. When youre ready, trade in your eligible device and T-Mobile will cover your remaining device payments up to half of your device cost.
How quickly after a device purchase can I upgrade?
There are no waiting periods on when you can upgrade with JUMP!. When you are ready to upgrade, trade in your eligible device and T-Mobile will pay off your remaining device payments, up to half of your original cost. Any remaining EIP balance must be paid at the time of upgrade.
When I originally signed up for JUMP!, I was told I had to wait to upgrade and also had a limit on how frequently I could upgrade in a year.  What happened?
Customers have spoken, and weve listened. Weve simplified the original program by removing these limitations to truly give customers control over when to upgrade. Unlimited upgrades with no waiting periods means ultimate freedom.
Im a current JUMP! customer.  How can I take advantage of this new program?
Customers who added JUMP! before 02/23/2014 will be subject to the existing terms of the program, however, once you upgrade to a new device, you may migrate to the new program at no additional costs.
Are prepaid phones and tablets eligible for JUMP!?
No, prepaid devices are not financed on EIP, so they are not eligible.
I usually upgrade my phone every couple of years.  Is JUMP! right for me?
JUMP! is designed to give you full control of your upgrade frequency as well as ultimate peace of mind when it comes to your device. If youd like to fully protect your device investment as well as have the flexibility to affordably get one of our new devices released in the future, JUMP! is for you.
How is JUMP! different from the other carriers' upgrade programs?
JUMP! is the only comprehensive program among the major national carriers that protects a customers phone investment from virtually any eventuality
including
obsolescence. JUMP! includes device protection and mobile security features that other carriers may charge separately for, so you get what you want  device peace of mind and the ability to upgrade when you want, not when youre told.
How does the JUMP! program reward me for staying with T-Mobile?
Not only do you get peace of mind with device protection and mobile security, you also get the benefit of T-Mobile paying off the remaining payments of your current device when you trade it in, up to half of your device cost. Upgrade to our latest and greatest devices, any time you want, as often as you want. Only T-Mobile offers this kind of comprehensive, all-in-one device program.
What if I change my mind and dont want JUMP! anymore?
You can remove the JUMP! feature any time, but you can only add it within 14 days of a new device purchase financed on EIP.
