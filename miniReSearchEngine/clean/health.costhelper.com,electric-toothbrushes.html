Also called a power toothbrush, an electric toothbrush typically consists of a handle with removable brush heads. The cleaning action may be vibration, a back-and-forth action; rotation-oscillation, where bristles move back-and-forth and also revolve; or sonic/ultrasonic using sound wave energy to move bristles at high velocity. Standard brushing with a manual toothbrush typically provides 300 strokes per minute; a basic vibrating toothbrush typically provides 3,000-7,500 rotating motions a minute; and a sonic or ultrasonic toothbrush can create 30,000-40,000 strokes per minute.
Typical costs:

each; and the Oral -B Pro Health Dual Action Battery Toothbrush

.
Rechargeable power toothbrushes can cost
$20-$200
depending on the type of cleaning action and options like a built-in timer (so users brush for the minimum recommended time); varying bushing modes like sensitive teeth, gum massage or whitening; pressure sensors to indicate when the user is brushing too hard; digital reminders to replace the brush heads; a docking or storage unit; or a UV sanitizing unit for the brush heads. For example, the Oral-B Pulsonic Sonic Toothbrush

What should be included:
Non-rechargeable battery-operated toothbrushes typically don't include the batteries. Rechargeable toothbrushes generally need to be charged for 12-24 hours before the first use. Many power toothbrush packages come with more than one brush heads, for multiple users or future replacements.
Always read and follow the manufacturer's instructions for brushing. A vibrating toothbrush is typically used with a technique similar to brushing with a manual toothbrush; for rotating-oscillating or sonic brushes the brush is typically moved slowly from tooth to tooth.

As a general rule, most people should brush their teeth at least twice a day, with each period of brushing lasting two to three minutes. If used properly, a manual toothbrush can be just as effective as an electric one. However, studies show that most Americans brush for only 30-60 seconds. Most power toothbrushes have a timer, making it more likely that users will brush the minimum two minutes. And because it makes brushing easier and requires less effort to use, an electric toothbrush can be a good choice for elderly or disabled people with limited manual dexterity.

Additional costs:
The brush head of a power toothbrush typically needs to be replaced every 2-3 months; replacement heads can cost
$2-$25
each depending on brand and model, and whether they're brought individually or in packs of two, three, four or more.
Shopping for an electric toothbrush:
Make sure the grip feels comfortable in the user's hand, and that the toothbrush head will fit easily in the user's mouth, allowing easy access to all tooth surfaces. WebMD.com lists tips for choosing a toothbrush
