Samsung OTR microwave Model SMH9207st - Wow, where to begin! I believe I bought this microwave in August of 2013. I will explain later why I don't know the exact date. In December of last year I got the dreaded SE code. I called Samsung (after reading all the horrible reviews about my microwave) and told them I was getting the dreaded code. They said since my microwave was over a year old, the warranty had expired and there was nothing they could do.
I asked to speak to superiors and went through four of them and they all told me there was nothing they could do. Sooo I threw away the receipt, the owners manual and the mounting screws. He took down the microwave and I told him to take the stupid thing to the dump. Luckily he hadn't done it yet because a couple days later I received an email from Samsung saying that they were going to pay for a one time parts and labor fix.
A company called me and set up date and time to come out. The tech came out and noticed that my microwave had scratches in the bottom and said it was a fire hazard and he didn't know if they would fix or not. I have heard online about the glass plate wobbling so maybe that is how it got scratched. They called back and said they ordered a new door and I would have to pay for the coating paint to cover the scratches and also the mounting screws. Tech came out and the door had the wrong connections and wouldn't work. Had to reorder. Came out today, replaced the door in a couple minutes and told me he was through...everything was working...clock, light, etc.
As he walked out the door I opened the door and closed it and it DIED! I called him back in and he made a phone call and said he would have to reorder another door! Going on almost three months so far and still no working microwave. Luckily a friend had an OLD $50 microwave that she let me use and it has worked wonderfully! I need to know how to join class action lawsuit. I just want a different microwave! FRUSTRATED!

After having my above-the-oven microwave for two years, the plastic handle broke off the screws it was attached to. After paying $45.95 for a replacement that I was told would be metal, was the same cheap plastic. Then trying to attach the new handle, you have to pry off the molding to get to the screws.

I am very surprised that Samsung has not had to recall their microwave ovens. All of a sudden the panel shows a code SE or E5 error code. The micro does just not go dead. It starts doing strange things..... constant beeping.... coming on by itself..... blinking lights. These are not old micros. Mine is not even three years old. I called Samsung. They were less than helpful and suggested we call a service center. They ignore the problem and will not even admit that there is a problem. I am done with Samsung Microwaves. Never had a problem with GE!

Samsung SMH2117S microwave - Samsung refused after various escalations to repair the "SE-" error code that made the OTR microwave go crazy. The fan initially kept turning itself on and off constantly, then would show the error code and die. Unplugging it and plugging it back in would briefly fix the issue, but then it just croaked for good. Just a few months out of warranty (of course), and now, for purely the principle, would join a CA lawsuit against Samsung despite the unlikely odds of that happening. Like most others here, we are adding Samsung (and Sony) to the list of god-awful businesses from which we will NEVER again purchase.

Our Samsung SMH9187ST starting having the same error code as many others have experienced. My wife discovered that pushing up on the keyboard panel and pressing Clear allowed her to clear the code and resume normal use, however, this was a very temporary fix. I removed the panel as someone recommended, and cleaned all of the connections...same problem. Then I read the post about using electrical tape to cover the ribbon cable. That worked for 2-3 days. On my last attempt, I added more tape around the silver section of the ribbon cable, and added some tape to the metal frame that the ribbon cable rests against. So far, it is working. I believe this should have been a recall. Now that I'm in the market for a 78" 4k Curved TV, I'm shopping all of the brands except Samsung. Their products are nice when they work, but it sounds like Samsung doesn't stand behind them when they don't work. I'm thinking LG or Sony for my next purchase.

Bought a whole appliance package for around $7000. Our Microwave (model MC17F808KDT-AA) went on the blitz by the light going on and off, the fan going on and off without being able to turn off without unplugging. Then after 8 visits from repair company under warranty repair, they are saying they need to replace the panel again! I have called Executive Customer Relations multiple times with my concerns about how it is electrical and that it is unsafe and so they send to some review board and deem it still repairable. When is it enough and refund my money? I will never and I mean never purchase a Samsung product again! Phone, electronics, appliance - nothing!!!

My kitchen was in desperate need of a makeover so I decided to purchase all new products from Sears and selected Samsung. I so wish that I would have checked with Consumer Affairs first before purchasing (3) Samsung products in 2013 - all of which have had issues. I purchased a double door black refrigerator, a black microwave as well as a black gas range. My refrigerator from day one has had issues with the ice maker not making ice and the refrigerator temperature not working properly.
The worst product of all was the microwave oven that caught fire while I granddaughter was cooking a hotdog on a paper plate. The plate caught on fire. There were sparks and flames literally shooting from the microwave. I didn't purchase the extended warranty on the microwave because my experience with good microwaves is that they simply stop working after about 6-7 years. They don't catch on fire! I paid $329 for the microwave and Samsung wanted to charge me $325 for the repairs and continue to give me the run around. The matter is still not resolved. So if you are reading this review... save yourself the trouble. Please do not purchase any Samsung product!

I have the ME179KFETSR unit installed by the builder. About a year after I moved in, it started doing wacky things. The light came on in the middle of the night. The time reset. And then it stopped working. Now I cannot do anything with it at all. This unit got minimal usage in a one-person household. It is outside the warranty. Most frustrating is that this happened about one month after the warranty expired.

The dreaded 5E display.... So I have a Samsung SMH 9187st microwave and have officially joined the club. My OTR microwave is just shy of 4 years and I guess a little luckier than most that I just got the error message. Googled a YouTube video by Joe ** where he showed step by step how to clean behind the panel. So far, so good. I just hope it holds.

I purchased a 3 appliance package including a OTR (over the range) microwave from Paul's TV with Samsung being the manufacturer. First the microwave has a "wobbly" glass tray, it wobbles. That's my problem because that's the way they are made. Then the microwave would just "shut off" if it was used more than about 7 minutes. Say, back to back, frozen dinners or heating up 25 minute casseroles. Called Paul's, had to talk to Samsung. Repairman comes out, orders a new circuit board. Comes back 2 weeks later and replaces board. In the middle of a big Christmas Party, microwave "shuts off" again. Then after 45 minutes, it turns itself back on. When I say "shut off", all electric, including clock is off. I call again. Was told it had to be "uninstalled" to be looked at. So I pay someone to take it out. Repairman said I didn't have to do that. Then he called after and said yes, he ordered another part, so it had to be out to be fixed. That was Dec 29th.
I have big New Year's party, and have to heat food in cooking pans, but now I don't have a VENT, since it was in the microwave. Today I called Samsung and was transferred to "Customer Relations" because it's January 16th, and the repairman has not shown up twice, yet Samsung keeps calling me to verify I've called him? I want my money back so I can get something else. Oh, that's too bad. Can't do that. Samsung pays $85 per repair call, he's been here 3 times, plus parts, so far for a $230 microwave. Their policy is to continue to repair until the repairman says it can't be fixed. SWEET job this repairman has. Lucrative contract. I NEVER want to buy another SAMSUNG product again, NEVER.
I've done FOUR kitchen remodels, with all new appliances and never had an issue like this, nor worked with such a stupid company. GE replaced my French Door the 2nd time out because of faulty production. No issue Kitchenaid. No issue Bosch. No issue Fisher & Paykel. No extra warranty. Now I have to wait 2 days so Samsung can reschedule with the repairman.

Just moved into my new house. Came equipped with Samsung microwave she 15th made in 2009. I should have known something was up as it was not plugged in. When plugged in, it spins and goes bonkers. When you can get it to accept numbers, it stops spinning. It melts bowls and never heats evenly. Having it replaced next week but costing me an additional 300 dollars. Sad.

I purchased a Samsung model #SMH9207ST one year and three weeks ago. It stopped working and I got the SE error code. I called for service, not once, not twice, but three times, and finally got an appointment. The service tech arrived an hour and a half late and had no idea what to do. Of course I was told it would be $99 for him just to walk in the door. I had a video from you tube that I had found about SE errors and he watched that and then called someone. He left, saying he would have to give me an estimate, and that the entire door might have to be replaced! It is only a touch over a year old and there are two of us in the house. This is ridiculous. I think Samsung should pay for repairs and parts.

When we were hit with the dreaded SE, Samsung finally agreed to fix my microwave even though it was a couple weeks out of warranty. About 6 months later, the microwave completely shut down. After many calls to Samsung, they said they would fix it if it was the SE problem again but we would need to pay the technician if it was anything else. I've been without a microwave for over 3 months trying to resolve this. Is there a class action suit filed yet?

We purchased this Samsung smh1816s microwave in the fall of 2013. By December 2013 the microwave quit working and displayed the "SE" or "5E" error code. Samsung repaired the unit under warranty only after 2 weeks (1 of which was Christmas week) with no microwave. Now (December of 2014) we are having the exact same issue, showing the exact same error code and Samsung customer service and "executive customer service" refuse to fix the microwave because it is out of warranty. I will NEVER recommend Samsung appliances to anyone else. I too would love to be part of a class action lawsuit filed against this company for selling knowingly defective equipment. You pay $300 for a Microwave you don't even get 18 months worth of use out of.....very poor way to conduct business Samsung!

One of the worst appliances I ever bought. Samsung over the range w/ hood model SMH1816S. First microwave in 30 years I ever had to have repaired. And customer support on an issue with it was horrendous, and then non-existent. I recommend anyone considering this unit to finish off their kitchen matched set of other Samsung products forgo aesthetics and get something else. First, as others have stated on other review sites, the control panel is awful. It is hard to read and the buttons are set in such a way (presumable to keep someone from pushing a button unintended with cleaning the panel) that you have to press very hard in exactly the right spot. No feel and go with this unit. The food, in spite of the revolving turntable, does not heat evenly. The stainless steel, for some odd reason, is difficult to clean (exterior).
We have had other stainless steel appliances from other companies that cleaned easily. Then, a short time after warranty expired, the unit failed to work. It turns out some of the factory work was not done well on the circuit board and a loose connection caused a short and burned out the primary "microwave" making unit. The dealer told us it was out of warranty, (barely) so we had it repaired, then one of their repair people said it was a defect, not a warranty issue and I should contact Samsung. Samsung used every excuse in the book, and finally said something along the lines of "policy does not allow us to ever pay out of pocket expense, regardless of the cause or situation". End of story, end of Samsung. Later, a salesperson told me they have had numerous complaints about the unit. Samsung TVs are great. We thought the refrig, range, dishwasher, microwave would be good, too. Not happy with the other units, but at least they work. But I will never own another Samsung appliances!

Samsung 2.0 cu ft Over-the-Range Microwave Model SMH9207ST - On August 21, 2013, we purchased this Microwave. On Sunday, December 14, 2014, it simply stopped working. After checking to see that the outlet was "hot," I attempted to "reset" the microwave by leaving it unplugged. Plugged it back in with no results, unless you count nothing happening as a result. This microwave replaced an earlier one from Samsung with the dreaded "SE" error code that we'd had for about 2 years. We got another Samsung because our experiences with 4 Samsung televisions, refrigerator and washing machine had all been good. Bad decision. I'll be replacing this one with a Whirlpool. I'm fairly certain that quality has probably been compromised over the past 20+ years, but there was a 3 year old Whirlpool microwave in the house when we bought the house and it didn't get replaced for another 18-19 years. I can't remember, but it may have been replaced because of its outdated styling, not because of any problems. We'll see how a 2014 generation Whirlpool microwave holds up.

Last night my Samsung microwave (SMH9207ST) was hit with the dreaded "SE error" while I was cooking dinner on the stovetop. My microwave is just over two years old. I called Samsung and they informed me that because I am outside of the warranty (1 year), the best they could do would be to cover the cost of the part while I would be expected to cover the labor. Of course this is where the bulk of the expense will be. The woman I spoke with (Michelle) acknowledged issues with other models but said that they have no evidence of flaws with the SMH9207ST. This wasn't a cheap microwave. Rather I spent the extra money hoping that I was getting a superior product. I guess I expected Samsung to also share my disappointed that their product was not meeting expectations. They said they would forward my complaint to their internal department. I hope to hear something back. It would be a small gesture to keep such a loyal customer.

I bought this a week ago. The buttons are almost impossible to push in. I have to use a pencil eraser to use the machine. I called for service and they sent a repairman out to humor me. I did not do my homework - I just went by the Samsung name. It used to be a good name. After I read the reviews on the thing I determined that most of the users had the same problem. I said to the repairman "you knew that this couldn't be fixed before you came out here." He just smiled and said, "If I replace the panel it will be the same problem - that's how they're made. I would have been better off with a $49 Walmart special. What a piece of garbage. Not to mention the time for my husband to install the thing. Now I read that it is a fire hazard. Something should be done about allowing a company to sell such an item. We are supposed to have laws against potential fire hazards and this one definitely qualifies.

I purchased an over the stove microwave Sept 17, 2014 from Lowe's Monroe, Michigan. Thanksgiving Day Nov 27, 2014 (yesterday) while warming up cheese dip I was smelling electrical burning. I looked and my Microwave, it was blowing black smoke out of the vents. I opened it up and my house filled with BLACK smoke. I turned it off. Needless to say it's only about 2 1/2 months old. I called Lowe's and they said I was out of the store warranty BUT they would sent out a service company. REALLY???!!!??? NEVER AGAIN SAMSUNG!!! Model # SMH2115. If I hadn't been standing in my kitchen, my house would have caught fire WITH 30 people inside of it for the holiday. Extremely dangerous.

Samsung smh9187st - Building a new house and having an old Emerson counter microwave, I put in the Samsung consumer report highly rated at the time in to find out the Samsung company does not even stand behind its products. For three years after installing it I did not use it since my Emerson worked fine. After the birth of my twins I started using it (16 months ago). First the door latch broke, no problem. I just fixed it. Next dreaded SE code put card board in between ribbon. Okay back in service. Yesterday while heating water for warming of twins milk, thing dies completely. Thank you Emerson at least your product is still working after more than ten years. After reading all I have on this issue Samsung products will not be bought by me ever again.

I should have done my homework before installed this almost 60 LB waste of space over our stove. Shortly a year after owning it, it began beeping in the night.
What we then found was the dreaded SE code had begun -- one only needs to Google it to learn all they need. Thankfully, there are actually YouTube videos showing how other consumers had to save their microwaves from this product failure...so we did it as well, and it worked...for about two months. And then the microwave stopped working entirely. What a waste of several hundred dollars! Shameful they just didn't stand by their products and recall and correct the issue.
DO NOT BUY THIS MICROWAVE!!

Samsung microwave SMH9187B - Microwave goes on for maybe a second, then loses power for a couple of seconds, then gets power again and clock has to be reset, etc. When it shuts itself off, there is an audible "click" in the control pad, at which time it dies... much like a circuit breaker tripping. The ribbon was stuck to itself and I separated it. Also I have tried cleaning all contacts, etc. and it does not help. Probably 2 years ago I had the control board replaced. Samsung actually covered the cost. Not sure now though. What a piece of garbage!

Electric fire with Samsung range-top microwave, model SMH1713S - Purchased from Lowe's Cerritos Town Center, Long Beach, CA, approximate price $300+/-. Normal use for less than one year, now producing smoke indicative of an electric short/fire in the mechanism. Also, failure of the main microwave generator as evidenced by lack of heating of material placed in the oven chamber. Major fire hazard, should be the subject of a recall from Samsung, but I do not see any indication that they have taken this type of action. Do not purchase Samsung microwave ovens. They are dangerous.

Samsung is a joke. Purchased a microwave that lasted only 3 years with minimal use. Got the SE error code. Called Samsung for help. They agreed to send out a service tech, well lo and behold NO ONE in my area will even deal with them. So basically Samsung told me it was my problem, but they were willing to repair it if a service technician was in my area. This process took me 3 weeks. They won't return calls, then transfer from one dept to the next, it is a total joke. They finally agreed to pro rate the cost of my microwave. This process took another 2 weeks. Needless to say I will NEVER again purchase from Samsung.
