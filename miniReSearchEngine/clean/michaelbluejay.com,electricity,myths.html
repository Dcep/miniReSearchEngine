Electricity
Myths
Does it take more energy to
turn on a light than to leave it on?
No. There's no power surge when you turn on a
light. Turning the light off ALWAYS saves electricity, even if it's for
just a second. (

)
Does it take more energy to
turn on a computer than to leave it on?
No. There's no meaningful power surge when you
turn on a computer. Turning the computer off ALWAYS saves electricity.
Of course, you can also use the power saver feature. (
more on computers...
)
Is there ANY consumer device
that uses more energy when you turn it on than when it's already on?
No, not in practical terms.
I don't believe you. Everyone
says there's a surge when you turn on computers and stuff.
There's a surge but
it's so tiny you
can't easily measure it.
That's because it happens for only a
fraction of a second, and the surge itself is modest. It's certainly
not costing you any extra money, not even a penny. So there's no surge
in
practical terms.
As far as you're concerned there's no surge at
all.
Think of it this way:
If a device used
twice
as much power as normal for
one full second
when you turned it
on, that would mean that it cost you
one whole extra second
of
electricity. Big deal. That's a fraction of a fraction of a fraction of
a penny. And in fact, the surge doesn't really last for a whole second,
it lasts for only a fraction of a second, and the surge isn't close to
twice as much power as normal, it's much less. Bottom line: Surge is so
incredibly insignificant it's really like there was no surge at all,
for all intents and purposes. There is
never
a penalty for
turning on a household device.
Does it take more energy to
cool a house in which the AC has been off all day, than to keep the AC
running at, say, 85 degrees during the day?
No. Cooling a hot house down at the end of the
day always takes less energy than leaving the AC running all day, even
if it's running on a high setting. (
more on
cooling...
)
Does a 240V device use more
electricity than the same device designed to run off 120V?
No. The electric company charges you for
watt-hours, not volts, and the wattage is the same. To figure volts you
use the fomula
V x Amps = Watts
. A device that uses twice as
many volts will use half as many amps, so the wattage will be the same
-- and so will the cost.
Electricity Facts
I heard that an electrical
wiring problem can lead to electricity "leaking" out of the wires and
into the abyss, causing a person to pay for electricity that they don't
use.
Yes, this is a possible.
Note that on an earlier version
of this page, I mistakenly listed this one as a Myth, but an
electrician corrected me. When the wiring isn't connected
correctly, it is indeed possible for electricity to "leak". The
electrician who contacted
me had a customer with a $15/mo. leak due to faulty wiring. On
another page I have
detailed instructions on
how to check for this kind of electricity leak
.
Besides mis-wiring, you could also have
undersized
wiring,
where
the wiring is too thin to handle the load being driven. When that
happens the wiring heats up. The extra heat generated represents
wasted energy, but more importantly, the extra heat can cause a fire
which can burn your house down. If you have a modern home which
had an electrical inspection when it was built then it's unlikely that
your wiring is inadequate. But if you have an older home or your
wiring was never inspected when installed, it's possible that your
wiring isn't sufficient for what you're running through it.
Unfortunately this isn't the kind of thing you can easily test
yourself. That's a job for a competent electrician.
