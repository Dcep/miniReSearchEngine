Urban myth: Is it really cheaper to leave your light on rather than switch it off and on again?
Can you really save money by switching off the lights? I've heard that you use more energy by switching them off and then on again, than you do by leaving them on?
A home energy expert, from not-for-profit energy group Ebico, replies:
The short answer is that you don't use up more energy turning lights on and off.
It is an urban myth that the extra electricity needed to switch lights back on is more than that saved by switching them off  but this is not the case.
Although normal incandescent light bulbs are being phased-out in favour of Compact Florescent Lamps (CFLs), there are many still out there in use.
These bulbs do not use more electricity to turn on than to run them, so you will always be using less energy by switching these light bulbs off when you dont need them.
CFLs (which use the same technology as the fluorescent tubes in strip lighting) require a small amount of extra electricity to light-up  but only about the same amount as it takes to run them for a minute or two. As a result, you will still use less electricity overall if you switch CFL lights off once youre finished with them.
There are number of positives to switching from incandescent bulbs to CFLs. They generally last several times as long as incandescent bulbs (be sure to check packaging for details on this) and operate on lower wattages to achieve an equivalent brightness.

In order to find an equivalent CFL to your incandescent bulbs, divide the wattage of the old bulb by four to find a CFL with the equivalent brightness. For example, a 15-watt CFL bulb will give as much light as a 60-watt incandescent bulb.
When purchasing CFLs its important to check the Colour Temperature of these. Many older CFLs produce quite a harsh blue-white fluorescent tube coloured light. These have a Colour Temperature of 5000K. For light closer to that given-out by an incandescent bulb, look for CFLs with Colour Temperatures nearer the 3000K mark.
As lighting accounts for around 15 per cent of home electricity usage, turning off your lights can play a part in reducing your energy use. By swapping all your existing standard light bulbs for new energy saving alternatives, you could be saving around 55 per year.
