If you are facing an
imminent shut-off of a vital utility service, such as gas, water, or electric service,
or you are having trouble affording your utility bills, there are ways to get
help. This article outlines some of the programs and laws available to reduce
your utility bills or prevent utility disconnection.
If you miss one months
utility billincluding a bill for heating oil or gas deliveriesyou probably
wont hear from the company, unless you have a poor payment history. If you
ignore a few past-due notices, however, the company will threaten to cut off your
service.
If that happens, you
must act quickly. Here are some things you can do to prevent the cut-off, or to
lower your bills so you can catch up and better afford future payments.
Contact the Utility Company
Call the company before
the threats become dire. Most utility companies will let you get two or three
months behind as long as you tell them when youll be able to make up what you
owe. If your service has been shut off, the company will most likely require you
to make a security depositusually for about three times the average of your
monthly billbefore it reconnects you. The deposit rates following disconnects are
regulated in some states. You may want to call a Legal Aid or Legal Services
office to learn about your states law.
Utility Discount Programs
Many utility companies
offer reduced rates and payment plans to elderly and low incomepeople. In
addition, the federal Low-income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), which
is state run, helps low income customers pay their utility bills. Dont assume
you wont qualify as low-income.
To find out if you
qualify and where to apply:
call the utility company and ask
contact the National Energy Assistance Referral
(NEAR) project at 866-674-6327 or
energy@ncat.org
, or
contact your states LIHEAP office for
assistance (you can find that office on theLIHEAP website at
www.acf.hhs.gov
,
look for energy assistance).
If you qualify for one
of these programs, youll be able to get future bills reducedand may be able
to spread out payments on past bills.
Programs That Average Your Bills Throughout the Year
Some consumers fall
behind on energy bills during periods when they use a lot of energy and incur
high bills (winter in the north, for example). Many energy utilities offer
programs that average your periods of high and low usage and allow you to pay uniform
monthly payment all year long.
Laws That Prohibit Utility Cut-Off During Extreme Weather
Most northern states
prohibit termination of heat-related utilities during the winter. Other states
protect households with elderly or disabled residents, and occasionally households
with infants. Usually, you must show financial hardship to qualify. But, even
if you qualify for a prohibition against utility shutoff, youll still owe the
bill.
Utility Conservation Assistance Programs
Finally, dont overlook
the cost savings that come with conserving energy. Local utility companies
offer utility conservation assistance programs, often at no cost. These
measures can often cut your bill by as much as one-third to one-half.
Filing for Bankruptcy
Filing for bankruptcy can provide a temporary stop to a
utility shut-off, but youll have to provide some proof that you can pay future
bills if you want to keep the termination at bay permanently. To learn more,
