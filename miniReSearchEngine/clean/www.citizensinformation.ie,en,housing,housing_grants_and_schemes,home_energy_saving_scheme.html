Introduction
The Better Energy Homes Scheme provides grants to homeowners to improve
energy efficiency in their homes. Landlords and owners of more than one
property can also apply for a grant under the scheme. It is administered by the
Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI).
Types of work covered
Grants are available for the following energy-saving work:
Roof insulation
Wall insulation - for example, cavity wall, internal dry lining or
    external insulation
Heating controls upgrade*
Installation of a high-efficiency boiler (more than 90% efficiency)
    including a heating controls upgrade
A Building Energy Rating (BER) after the energy-saving work is carried
    out (you
must
get this BER to qualify for the grant)
Solar heating
*SEAI will only fund certain heating controls upgrades with certain
functions. Also, while grants are available to upgrade heating controls for
heat pumps or biomass systems, you will not get a grant for this if you
previously got a grant under the old Greener Homes Scheme (now discontinued) to
install the system.
How to find out if your home would benefit from energy-saving work
You can use the
Home
Energy Self Survey
to identify areas in your home which could be improved
to increase its energy efficiency.
You can also get a Building Energy Rating (BER) done in advance of any
works. A BER assessor will energy rate your home and provide you with an
advisory report, which will help identify areas that could be improved to
increase the energy efficiency of your home.
Rules
You must have grant approval before you buy materials or start any
grant-funded energy-saving work. If you have already started work, you will not
be eligible for a grant.
However, a
before BER
can be done ahead of grant approval and could
prove useful if you are uncertain about your energy-saving options or what to
get done first.
To qualify for a grant you must:
Be the owner of a dwelling built before 2006
Use a contractor from
SEAIs
    registered list
Have a BER carried out
after
the works are done
Use a
BER assessor from
    SEAIs National Register
Apply for a minimum amount of 400 with your first application. You can
    apply for a number of grants under the scheme to reach the 400 minimum
    application amount but a BER grant cannot form part of this amount.
You may not get a grant if:
Your first grant application is for less than 400
You are replacing your existing boiler with a typical efficiency boiler
    of less than 90% efficiency
You replace your boiler but do not replace the heating controls
The work is part of any payment you received under the pilot for the old
    Home Energy Saving Scheme
SEAI publishes
detailed
FAQs about the Better Energy Homes Scheme
.
Planning permission
In general, you will not need
planning
permission
for the measures that are grant-aided under this scheme, though
you may require it for external wall insulation. This will depend on matters
such as whether the insulation will affect the external appearance of the
building or whether the building is a protected structure. Contact your
local
authority
to check if you need planning permission.
Getting the work done safely
Under the Regulations governing safety, health and welfare at work,
homeowners are obliged to ensure that construction work on their home is
carried out by competent people. Read more, including a
guide
for homeowners (pdf)
and some
Frequently
Asked Questions
, on the website of the
Health and Safety Authority
.
Home Renovation Incentive
As well as getting a grant under the Better Energy Homes Scheme, you may be
able to claim a tax credit on part of the cost of the work. Read more in
our document on the Home Renovation
Incentive
and in
these
FAQs published by Revenue
.
Rates
Grants are paid after the work is completed and you have paid your
contractor.
Applications received from
specific
offshore islands
are eligible for 50% additional grant support.
If the cost of the work (including
VAT
) is less
than the maximum grant amount, you will get a grant for the actual cost of the
work.
If you are claiming a tax credit under the Home Renovation Incentive, the
amount of expenditure that qualifies for the credit will be reduced, as
outlined in
this
FAQ
.
