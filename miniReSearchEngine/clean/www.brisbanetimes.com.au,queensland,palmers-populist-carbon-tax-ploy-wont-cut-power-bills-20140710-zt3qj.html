If you heard
Clive Palmer and his Palmer United senators say
that they will only scrap the carbon tax with
stronger rules to protect consumers
, you might have thought they sounded quite fair and reasonable. Actually, its populist hokum.
And if youre expecting to see your power bills go down when the carbon tax is eventually repealed, rather than keep rising, get ready to be disappointed.
Standing up for consumers?
Palmer United Party thwarts the Abbott Government's bid to repeal the carbon tax this week.

In
a chaotic day in Parliament
, the Senate has defeated the governments carbon tax repeal. That came after Palmer surprised everyone at a media conference earlier in the morning by claiming he and his senators had been double-crossed by the Coalition over amendments to ensure carbon tax savings are passed on in full to Australian families and businesses.

Palmer United Senator Glenn Lazarus declared this week that his partys historic amendment would:
deliver a toughened obligation for suppliers of electricity, natural gas and synthetic greenhouse gases to pass on all cost savings resulting from the carbon tax repeal; it also requires suppliers to clearly explain to the ACCC [Australian Competition and Consumer Commission] and customers the way in which cost savings have been calculated and passed on to consumers.
But are the Palmer United amendments really necessary? And will you save money on your power bills thanks to their proposed changes? On both counts, from what Ive seen the answer is no.
Instead, it looks more like making sure that when the carbon tax is eventually repealed, the Palmer United Party can gain credit for what is already included in the legislation.
First, the carbon tax repeal legislation already covers
Australian Competition and Consumer Commission
monitoring on prices after the carbon tax repeal. As the
Explanatory Memorandum states
:
The ACCC will have new powers to monitor prices and take action against businesses that attempt to exploit other businesses and consumers by charging unreasonably high prices or making false or misleading claims about the effect of the carbon tax repeal on prices.
So at best the PUPs historic amendment is adding some detail to obligations that are already in the legislation.
However, even these obligations are unnecessary. To see this, it is important to know how electricity prices are set.
Understanding your power bills
Roughly speaking, retail electricity prices paid by households are either set by a regulator or are set by the market. As the
Australian Energy Regulator
notes:
In Queensland, New South Wales, the ACT and Tasmania, you can ask for a contract with a regulated electricity price.
When the carbon tax is repealed, these regulated prices will be adjusted for the reduction in cost. However, this may not occur immediately. It will depend on the regulatory process. The prices will be changed at the next reset unless the regulator made provision for the potential removal of the carbon tax the last time it set the prices.
So there is little point in having either the ACCC monitor this process or electricity retailers explain it. Any delay depends on the regulators, not business exploitation.
Alternatively, large business customers and households in Victoria and South Australia do not have regulated tariffs but rely on retail competition. But even for these unregulated tariffs, the ACCC monitoring is unlikely to make a real difference.
Electricity retailers buy their power in two ways. They can either buy on the spot market or through forward contracts with generators.
The spot prices are arguably the most transparent prices in Australia. But they are also some of the most volatile and can vary between a negative price and a price up to almost $13,000 per
megawatt hour
. The relatively small change due to the repeal of the carbon tax will be swamped by the normal volatility of power prices in the short term. So even if the ACCC wanted to check the effect, it is not going to be able to do so.
The contracts between retailers and generators will have the carbon price built in. And, when they are renegotiated, the effect of the carbon price will be removed. But that will not be instantaneous. Once this occurs, competition will pass the price fall onto customers. And if you think your electricity retailer is not acting fast enough, then shop around. There are plenty of retailers out there.
So the PUP amendment, and ACCC price monitoring more generally, is an attempt by politicians to claim credit for changes that will happen anyway.
However, these attempts are not without cost.
Why your bills are really rising
Electricity prices are rising, but thats mainly due to changing demand for network assets.
Network prices have risen rapidly over the past few years. For example, in New South Wales average annual power bills more than doubled between 2007-08 and 2013-14,
soaring from A$1013 to A$2073
, with
A$580 or more than half
of that rise due to
increased costs for the network of poles and wires
. In comparison, the carbon tax added A$172. And as
the Australian Financial Review reported today
, the state-owned NSW network companies are seeking further price rises.
In part these price increases reflect falling demand for network assets. The networks have fixed costs and
as consumers buy less power through the network
, the cost per unit of power goes up. This feedback loop  from falling demand to higher prices to even further reductions in demand  has been called a
death spiral
.
While the repeal of the carbon tax may be political theatre, it simply distracts attention from the real problems facing Australias electricity networks.
With electricity prices set to keep rising after the carbon tax is repealed, due to factors that have nothing to do with the carbon tax, the ACCC will face a lot of pressure to find a culprit to blame. Hopefully, the regulator will stand its ground. But it may also be tempted to find a scapegoat. In that case, watch out if you are an electricity retailer. Unless every i is dotted and every t' is crossed, you may be named and shamed, destroying significant business value.
But of course, this just creates an implicit regulatory burden. And eventually that will also be reflected in the price households pay for their electricity.
So if you are expecting the repeal of the carbon tax to lead to lower power prices, dont hold your breath.

Hook, line and sinker Australia. You gave Clive Palmer the mandate, now he is using it. There is only room for one minor political party in Australia. Who will it be PUP or the Greens?

The Greens are looking like the shining light of policy credibility and common sense when compared to the rest of them at the moment.
Australia. You got what you thought you wanted from the last election and there were so many protest votes. Now you have to put up with it. This should be a lesson for all of us.

When Abbott was leader in opposition he dished up that much crap and said no to everything. Now you say its not right to say no to Abbott. Is the present opposition leader still named Shorten or is he on holidays? Go Clive bring them to account.

I'l simplify this whole thing about power, at the moment I'm paying 28 cents per Kwh (Kilo Watt Hour) after the carbon tax is gone if that rate doesn't come down to 25.2 cents (10% less) per Kwh Tony Abbott has lied to me about the affect of the carbon tax and I will be voting him out at the next election, if you want to find out how much you pay per Kwh look on the back of your bill, save it and make sure yours comes down by 10% as well, this is the only true way to show that your power bill has come down by the promised 10%, it's as simple as that.

@Bushy... I hope you're better at kicking out Abbott at the next election than you are at maths. Add 10% to your 25.2 cents and see what you come up with ;)
@Grey Nomad...You're spot on. Abbott was the most disruptive opposition leader EVER in Australian politics and now demands peace. He was a hypocrite then and nothing has changed. Wong or Plibersek should be taking Abbott to charge. Both are powerful communicators and he wouldn't know how to handle them.

I'd rather have PUP any day. The Greens have proven themselves when Labor was in power. They crawled up Gillard and Gillard would jump whenever they asked her to, just to get their votes. What is so different this time?  The only difference is the parties.  PUP puts the people first while Greens put the environment first, with the people and their jobs last. You need to meet a happy medium.

@Neal, 10% of 28 cents is 2.8 cents, take 2.8 from 28 and that leaves you 25.2, learn how to count before you open your big mouth because it can make a fool out of you!!!!
You must have learnt arithmetic off Joe Hockey.

Believing that the carbon tax was a wrecking ball/ python sqeeze to the economy was what caught (some) Australians hook line and sinker. Nobody noticed it affecting them much when it went on, and they will notice it's passing even less.
