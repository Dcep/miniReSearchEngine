How Many BTUs Does a Furnace Need for a House?
How Many BTUs Does a Furnace Need for a House?
by Tony Guerra
New high-efficiency furnaces typically cost $5,000 to $8,000, including installation.
A BTU is a British Thermal Unit, or a measure of thermal or heat energy. BTUs are used to determine thermal energy output in a variety of devices, including furnaces. A typical home furnace produces thousands of BTUs and installing one that meets your home's heating needs is vital. If your home's furnace is too large, it will turn on and off too often and lose efficiency and, if it's too small, it will run too often and won't adequately heat your home.
BTUs per Square Foot
Heating and air conditioning contractors use various load calculations to determine furnace sizes for homes and these calculations are often complex. But there are also "rule-of-thumb" estimations you can use to pick a furnace size for your home. For cooler climates, a very broad estimate of furnace sizing is to select one that generates 40 to 45 BTUs per square foot. At 40 to 45 BTUs per square foot, you'd need a 100,000 to 112,500 BTU furnace to heat your 2,500-square-foot home.
Heating Degree-Day Calculation
A heating degree-day calculation, using the month of July as a factor, is a more precise way of estimating furnace size. Natural gas for a furnace is priced by the therm, or per 100,000 BTUs. Therms are listed on your home's gas bill in annual and monthly usage rates. The heating degree-day calculation for a furnace is 50 x heating therms x furnace efficiency = load in BTUs/hour. Your furnace must produce a certain load, measured in BTUs per hour, to heat your home.
Calculating Your Furnace Size
Suppose your home uses 1,500 therms of natural gas annually, your July usage rate is 25 therms and your furnace is 82 percent efficient. For a heating degree-day calculation, subtract 12 x 25, or your July usage rate, from your annual therm usage rate of 1,500, or 1,500 - 300 = 1,200, or your home's therm heating load. Your home's heating degree-day calculation formula would be 50 x 1200 x .82, or 49,200. Using heating degree-day calculations, a 50,000 BTU furnace can adequately heat your home.
Furnace Heating Efficiency
New furnaces come with a yellow energy guide attached that provides their energy efficiency ratings. Different furnaces also deliver different efficiency levels. For example, if your furnace is 82 percent efficient, it's delivering 82 percent of its fuel into your house as heat. The greater your furnace's efficiency, the lower its fuel usage rate is, meaning it will be less costly to operate. More efficient furnaces also tend to cost more, at least up front, but they're typically less costly over the long term.
