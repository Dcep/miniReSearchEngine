Natural Gas vs. Electric appliances
Last update: February 2015
Gas is almost always cheaper than electricity.
Your situation might be different depending upon local andcurrent prices, though. To do an accurate comparison,you'll need to check your bills to find the rates for electricand gas that you're paying to your particular providers.There's no way around this; you can't get meaningful results ifyou skip that step.
Also, if you don't alreadyhave gas service, then signing up for it means that you'll pay~$12/mo. or so to the gas company for the privilege of beingtheir customer.
You're also looking at the costof having the gas lines run if your home doesn't already havethem. These things can quickly erase the savings of gasappliances over electric in many to most situations.
While gas is generallycheaper, it does have a couple of downsides.
With gas your house is
more
likely to explode
. And the byproducts of gascombustion from ovens and heating are unhealthy to breathe,and can actually kill pet birds. For these reasons, Iuse electric instead of gas in my own home. Of course,my energy use is so small that the extra cost of electricityis minimal for me. Likewise, I hope to help my readersreduce their energy consumption so that the difference betweenelectric and gas costs for them is insignificant.

Chart
from DoE. Divide price by 10 to get price per therm or perCCF.
Cost of Natural Gas
Natural gas prices are all over the map, literaly.
First of all, prices vary greatly by region. The price inFlorida is double the price in California. Prices havealso jumped wildly in short periods of time. The averageU.S. price doubled from 2005 to 2008, and then fell by half from2008 to 2011. (The chart at right shows prices for thelast few decades.) Still, even when gas prices are attheir highest, it's generally cheaper to run appliances onnatural gas instead of electricity.
The national average price of residential gas was $1.29/Ccfin 2014.
(
source
)
(Ccf and therms are roughly the same, more on this later.)But average prices are useless for calculating your own costsand savings potential since costs vary widely by area andbecause they can change quickly. That goes forstate-by-state averages too, because the price from your ownprovider likely differs at least somewhat from the stateaverage.
(
prices
by state
)
On this site I have to use
something
for calculationsand defaults, so I often use $1.30/therm or Ccf, which is closeto the 2014 average.
Natural gas is measured in Ccf or therms.
Forcalculation purposes, they're essentially the same (1 ccf = 1therm). There's no direct conversion because ccfmeasures the volume of gas, while therms measures the energyin the gas, and the amount of energy varies by the quality ofgas. It's like trying to state how many calories are ina loaf of breadit depends on the bread. In the U.S. in2013, the average was 1 therm = 1.025 ccf.
(
source
)
That's so close that for most purposes, therms and ccf areessentially interchangeable. Based on the above:
Ccf
= hundred cubic feet. The "C" is romanfor one hundred. Ccf  1.025 = therms.
Mcf
= thousand cubic feet. The "M" is romanfor one thousand, not an abbreviation for million. Mcf 10 = Ccf. Mcf  10.25 = therms.
Therm
= 100,000 Btu. therms x 1.025 =ccf. therms  100,000 = Btu.
Btu
= British thermal unit. Btus x 100,000 =therms.
Some gas bills measure the gas in cubic meters instead oftherms. One therm is 2.75 cubic meters, and 1 cubicmeter is 0.36 therms.
Cost of Electricity
The average cost of residential electricity was
13/kWh
in the U.S. in 2014, though as I explain elsewhere,
average
rates are all but useless
for figuring how much you payfor electricity. The average U.S. household used 909kWh/mo. in 2013 and would pay $118.17 for it at the 13/kWhaverage rate.
(
Dept.
of Energy
)
Like gas,the cost of electricity varies by location. Don't assume thestate rates are accurate for you, because rates vary even withina state.
I have more info about electric costs on our
cost
of electricity page

Comparing the operating cost of electric vs. gas appliances
Above I provide calculators for comparing the cost ofgas and electric appliances. For those who prefer tocrunch the numbers themselves, here's what you'll need to know:
The price of electricity in kWh.
The amount of electricity used in kWh.
The price of gas in therms.
The amount of gas used in therms.
#1 and #3 are easy to find, just look at your bill. Forelectricity, make sure you add all the kWh costs forelectricity, since some utility companies have separatecharges for delivery and fuel. (

.)
#2 is also pretty easy, using the tables and methodsdescribed on this site. For starters, here's our page of
electricity
used by typical appliances
, and
how
to measure electrical use
.
#4 is usually the hardest, because the amount of gas used byappliances for a given task or amount of time is usually notso easy to find. But I'll make it easy by listing thosefigures for you now, and throw in the electric version forcomparison, in the table at right.
Gas used by the pilot light
Thegas used by pilot lights is substantial.
At$1.40/therm, you're looking at $183/yr. to run the pilots in afurnace and a water heater, not even counting a stove.Pilots could easily account for over 70% of summer gas usage,and 40% of total usage.

If your furnace has a pilot, turn itoff during the non-heating months. (You can't just blow itout, because gas will still flow, and soon your house will blowup.) For your stove, turn off the burner pilots and use aclick-lighter to light them. And the next time you replaceyour appliances, get the ones that have electric ignition.
In the winter, the energy from thepilot lights isn't wasted since it adds heat to your home.But when you're not running a heater, then pilot lights are 100%wasteful.
While Murphy's
pilot
light
article gives 3.3 therms/mo. for a water heaterpilot light, his
water
heating
page suggests 4.2 therms, as follows:
510 Btu per meter revolution, with ten revolutions in 11.2hours. That's one revolution every 1011.2 = 0.893h.
At 30.4375 days in a month times 24 hours/d, that's 730.5h/mo. So 730.5 h/mo.  0.893 h/rev = 818 revs/mo.
That's 818 revs./mo. x 510 Btu/rev = 417,180 Btu/mo..
At 1 therm = 100,000 BTU, 417,180 Btu  100,000 = 4.17therms.
