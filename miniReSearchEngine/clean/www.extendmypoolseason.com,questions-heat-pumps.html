Why heat my pool?
You bought your pool for a number of reasons like family fun, exercise, entertaining and possibly even therapeutic reasons. However you've probably found that without heating your pool it's often too cold to enjoy. Heating your pool will allow you to enjoy it all season, perhaps all year round, thereby increasing the return on your sizable investment.
Choosing the right heating system
There are three basic types of pool heating systems: Solar, Electric Heat Pump, and Gas (Natural or Lp/Propane). Deciding which system is the best match for you and your pool is determined by considering the factors below:

Water temperature desired

Swimming season desired

Geographic location / climate

Spending plans / project budget

The size/shape of the pool, plus shading/wind factors

Cost of operation

Types of Heat Pump pool heaters
There are two basic types of pool heat pumps. The most common is "Air-Source", the other being "Water-Source". Air Source Heat Pumps, use air as a heat source. Water Source Heat Pumps get their heat source from water i.e. lake, river, or well water. In the section below we explain how "air-source" heat pumps work. Water source units are generally used for special applications; for more information on water source units, call our help desk at 800-333-9276.
How does a Heat Pump work?
"Air Source" Heat Pumps utilize the sun's free heat by collecting and absorbing energy from the outside air. This energy is then compressed and transferred to the pool water.
Your existing pool pump circulates the water through the heater and warms the pool. The
fan
circulates air through the outer
evaporator air coil
that acts as a heat collector. The liquid refrigerant in the air coil absorbs the available heat in the ambient air transforming it into a gas. The refrigerant gas is then pumped into the
compressor
. When this warmed gas is compressed, it intensifies or concentrates the heat like a magnifying glass in the sun. This intensely hot gas is then pumped into the
heat exchanger condenser
where the actual heat transfer takes place.
As the pool water passes through the heat exchanger, the hot gas gives up its heat to the cooler pool water. The refrigerant returns to a liquid state and is pumped through the
expansion valve
then into the evaporator air coil to start the process all over again.
How will a Heat Pump perform?
Heat pump technology can efficiently collect heat from the outside air down to the 45 to 50 degree range. For tropic and sub tropic climates, this means that the pool can be maintained at 80 to 90 degrees under almost all conditions all year round. In northern climates, a Heat Pump will greatly extend the swimming season. For temperatures below 45 degrees, a Hot Gas option can be added which will allow the Heat Pump to continue to collect heat; however, efficiency drops as the temperature drops.
To determine the potential swimming season in your area, see the Solar Insolation Map and chart below:

Do I need a pool cover?
A
Thermal Pool Cover
is recommended for all heating systems. Heating a pool without a cover is like heating a house without a roof...the heat just goes right out the top. Without a pool cover, the cost of operating a Heat Pump or Gas Heater is doubled, and a Solar Heater's effectiveness is dramatically decreased. For convenience a roller may be added to ease placement and removal of the cover. If a pool cover is not being used, the size of the heater must be increased by 75% - 100%. Pool covers range in cost from $50 to $200 for residential pools; Pool blanket rollers offered in many styles and quality start at $185.
Cost of Operation
Example: The chart below illustrates pool heating costs with and without a cover for each month when heating is required. To maintain 80 degrees water temperature in a 14 x 28 pool, 4ft. average depth, low wind speed, in Ft. Myers, Florida, @ .070/kwh local electric will cost approximately:
To heat this pool with a Heat Pump @ .070 /Kwh would cost: "With A Cover " $291.00 Per Year. "Without A Cover" $726.00 /Yr.
NOTE:
To heat the same pool with a L.P. Gas Heater @ $1.50/Gal. would cost: "With A Cover" $2,036.00 Per Year. "Without A Cover" $5091.00 /Yr.
A pool heat pump will heat your pool for 70% to 80% less money than a L.P. gas type heater and 50% to 60% less than natural gas type heaters. Heat pumps cost far less to operate than any other "demand type" pool heater period. Heating costs vary with: geographic location, desired water temperature, wind speed, sun exposure, use of cover and swim season. The Energy SuperMarket can provide you with a computerized report detailing the estimated cost of operation based on your exact pool criteria by calling 888-333-9276 or by printing the sizing form below.
What size do I need?
Sizing of a heat pump pool heater is based on the pool's surface area, geographic location, environmental conditions such as shading, wind, blanketing against night time heat losses, and more. See
sizing
.
Can I install it myself?
Each model of heat pump can be installed by the handyman, although it is strongly recommended that the electric hookups be made by a professional contractor. It typically takes less than a day to have a heat pump installed and running. Installation manuals are included with each Heat Pump.
Energy Rating and Efficiency
Pool/Spa heat pumps are rated on B.T.U. output and C.O.P. efficiency: B.T.U. [British Thermal Units] is the measured amount of heat output the unit will produ
