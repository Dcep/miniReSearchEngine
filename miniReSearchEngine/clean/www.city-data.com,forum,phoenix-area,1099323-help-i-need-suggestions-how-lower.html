Hello All,
I have been living in the Gilbert area for approximately a month, we have rented a single family 1 story house with pool approx. 1900 square foot.  We use SRP as our electric company and are on the 1pm-8pm plan.  I recently went online to browse the sight and found the estimation tool, well, to my surprise for 9 days of electric my estimated bill was $220.
Now I knew the electric bill would be higher here than in my previous state (NJ) but that amount was a shock to me.
We are a family of four, run the pool filter about 5 hours a day (off peak) and leave the air on 80 when we r home and 86 when we r out. Washer and dryer only used off peak as well and used every other day. We use a crock pot, grill, stove top for dinners and try to avoid using the oven.   Lights r on only when needed and TV usage is a couple of hours a day (peak & off peak combined).
We have tried to be as diligent as possible, are we missing something??  Any hints or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!!
Thanks
Kim

Did you have to put down a deposit?  Have you checked your attic?  Is it blazing hot?  Or is it cold?  If it's cold, you have an A/C leak.  Do you have fans in the attic?  Do you have double paned windows? Do you have any type of coverings on them?  Are you north/south facing or east/west?
We have 1850 sq ft 2 story house and our bill was around $280 (down $60 from last month), but I keep it cooler at night (around 72) and 80 during the day, no pool.  Our house is north/south facing with double paned windows and coverings on the west facing ones.  We also have APS and not SRP.  The winters not only bring nicer weather, but lower electric bills as well.

If your hot water heater is electric you may want to turn the temperature down to 100-110 degrees as you'll probably find its up at about 150 degrees.
I,ve turned mine down to 100 and its only drawback is you have to wait a few hours between people taking a shower but on the plus side that electric meter wheel certainly doesnt spin so fast so often.
That pool could be another source of energy output as pumps and heaters take up power, you may want to reduce the time you run pumps,filters and heaters.

Put a time clock on the water heater and run it off peak. I think you can have an energy audit on the house by SRP. That bill seems really high for such high temperatures. Most of the bill is AC. Maybe an old unit or leaky ducts.

Check for airtightness of doors and windows. I've not used that "estimation tool" before, so I don't know if there could have been an issue with that performing incorrectly.  That "estimated bill" seems ridiculously high.

$220 is way too much, are you sure they aren't estimating your bill for the whole month based on 9 days of usage?

I'm with observer53, that sounds extremely high for 9 days.  Before you get too concerned, I'd wait to see what your first real bill looks like.  We are also starting to hit cooler weather, so AC cost should start dropping.
Edit: I agree, probably a monthly estimate based on your 9 days usage.  That would be much more reasonable.

It's the heat!  It's really expensive to cool a house, ready for a shocker, I am a larger household of course with 6, in a 4 bedroom, 2 story with a pool.  I do have a lot of electric plugged in but my bill in the summer months is 700.00 a month.
I busted my but, like you trying to lower it but when winter hits it drops by 500.00 dollars.  So, it's must be the air conditioner.
Some people have a house that is more efficient but in reality, most homes here are built shotty and don't hold in the cool air, leaving most of us with extreme cooling bills.
I try to warn newcomers of how much more it is to cool a home here but get told I'm just a bummer and hate this state.  For some reason on here most have really efficient homes and lower electric bills but amongst my friends and neighbors it's pretty high for all of us.
Your bill will most likely be around 4 to 500 dollars a month in the summer, but it will lower considerably in the winter months.  Maybe around 175, etc.
Sorry you found out this way, but like I always say, AZ is known for it's cheap housing but that doesn't mean it will cheap to live here.  We have other cost and our pay is usually lower.  Some people will not have this issue, but it's more common to have it than not to have it.
If you get on the plan that totals it for the year and lets you evenly spread it out over 12 months you will be able to at least judge what the total will be ever month.  So, instead of the ups and downs, you have 350 every month.  Then at least you can plan for it because some winter months can get hot enough to raise the bill when your not expecting it and if you are on any kind of a budget, it's not a pleasant surprise.
All the tips on here are good, I've tried them, but they didn't really make much of a difference.  Instead of 735.00 our bill was, 703.00.  Nice to save 30 dollars but not the savings you are hoping for.
It's just an AZ house and that means you are cooling the whole neighborhood with everyone else.  lol  Sure, you can live with nothing plugged in the whole summer, and the air at 90 but who can really do that?  It would be miserable!
It cost more to cool than to heat your home because everything electric in your home, appliances, etc. are also giving off heat.  It's an uphill battle, one reason we dread summer.  But the good news is you're finding this out at the end of summer, and by Dec. you will see lower bills for sure.  Just plan for it come May.  Now you know you will have to make room for the ac bill in your budget.
Next time, try renting a house thats only 2 years old, that might help with all the "electric saving" new energy efficient items that have come out recently but they are usually far out lying and the drive will be long.  So, better to plan for the bill.
On a good note, it's a dry heat!
lol

220 must be your monthly estimate, but frankly, even that seems high, as careful as you are being. If that's the actual bill at the end of the month (and with cooler weather starting this week, it may not be) then I agree with the energy audit.
Then, the year round managed payment plan makes sense, also.
Twiggy,
700 a month is an insane electric bill, even in the size house you describe. Have you considered an energy audit yourself? (I don't know what your thermostat settings are).

Since your renting your home, there isn't much you can do...
Replace as much bulbs as you can with CFL, maybe buy some weather stripping for windows and doors.  Unplug any chargers , DVD/blu-ray players, game consoles when there not in use. They can use a small amount of electricity even when not in use.  Change your fridge to the energy saver option.  Try to use laptops instead of desktop computers, they use less electricity.
My bill was 160 last month. I have a 13 seer a/c unit, mostly CFL, energy efficient appliances. 1500sq feet home. Air is on 82 during day, 78 at night.
