DANIEL HANNAN: Banning vacuum cleaners isn't about saving the planet - it's about Brussels grabbing even more power

Customers have been thronging High Street stores, like Boxing Day crowds, snapping up the last legal appliances that use more than 1,600 watts
Extremist parties are on the rise across Europe. The disaster of the French economy threatens to re-ignite the euro crisis. Russia is invading Ukraine. And what is the EU doing? Banning high-power vacuum cleaners.
Customers have been thronging High Street stores, like Boxing Day crowds, snapping up the last legal appliances that use more than 1,600 watts  the maximum power-limit decreed by Eurocrats and national politicians (including our own).
But it doesnt stop there. Brussels is methodically working its way through our homes, proscribing any household machines that are deemed to use too much electricity. Televisions, dishwashers, tumble-dryers, toasters: all must now conform to the new low-power rules.
School sixth-formers used to debate whether the State had any place in the bedroom. Well, never mind the bedroom: I want the Government out of my bloody kitchen.
The last time we saw similar panic-buying was when the EU banned proper lightbulbs in 2009. A kind of dual stockpiling followed: retailers amassed the soon-to-be-outlawed incandescent bulbs, and consumers did the same.
Only now, five years on, have we ploughed through both sets of reserves. As a result, our rooms are lit by the strange light that comes from the low-quality halogen or LED versions.
Of course, the dimming of the lights may be useful when it comes to hiding the muck that vacuum cleaners are meant to remove. Various consumer organisations, including Which?, recommend the high-suction cleaners as the best way of extracting dirt rather than pushing it around.
I cant claim to be any sort of authority on hoovering. There are, in fairness, arguments on both sides. Plenty of people  including, for what its worth, my wife, whom I treat as the leading authority  think that the ban is disproportionate and harmful. And, given the panic-buying of vacuum cleaners (theres a phrase I never expected to write) most consumers evidently agree with Mrs H.
On the other hand, Sir James Dyson  who makes the things and, we can fairly assume, knows a thing or two about them  argues that there is no need for a properly designed machine to take such a high wattage.

Still, its only fair to point out that, since Sir Jamess appliances meet all the specifications anyway, he might be expected to say that. The ban, after all, will disadvantage his competitors, and so suit him.
Whether Dyson lobbied for the ban, Ive no idea. But its something Ive seen again and again in Brussels. A regulation that is brought in for supposedly altruistic reasons  such as improving consumer safety or reducing greenhouse gases  is actually the result of intense lobbying by special interests.
When I first became an MEP, I innocently thought that businesses would be opposed to regulation. How wrong I was. In fact, large corporations love EU rules. They know that they can easily meet the compliance costs, but that their smaller rivals will be put out of business.
And are we really supposed to believe that banning certain vacuum cleaners will save the planet?
It is often argued that the EUs 30 per cent carbon reduction target is symbolic rather than practical: the entire gain is offset several times over by the output of industrialising countries such as India, China, Brazil and Indonesia.
If all household electrical appliances in the EU were banned altogether, global carbon emissions would be reduced by around 1 per cent
There are currently 1,200 coal-fuelled power-stations in the pipeline in developing nations. Its hard to see how the EU can have any significant impact on overall greenhouse gas production when it accounts for just 12 per cent of total emissions. But the gadgets in question account for just 12 per cent of our total household energy use (which is itself only one part of our total carbon footprint). If all household electrical appliances in the EU were banned altogether, global carbon emissions would be reduced by around 1 per cent.
No, this isnt about saving the planet. Its about advantaging certain producers and, of course, extending the power of Brussels.
Every time the EU intervenes like this, it creates an allied lobby group: a cartel of producers who now have a vested interest in keeping the new regulations and thus, by implication, backing the Eurocrats who decree them. Its why large corporations tend to be so much more pro-Brussels than small and medium firms.
When I first became an MEP, I innocently thought that businesses would be opposed to regulation. How wrong I was
The irony of the whole thing is that, 40 years ago, we thought we had joined a common market. In reality, we have joined a common regulatory regime, which is more interested in restricting than in extending consumer choice  the opposite of a common market.
Next on the EUs hit-list are high-energy hairdryers. Again, certain manufacturers, which happen already to meet regulations, will piously claim that we all have to do our bit for the environment.
Undemocratic
But I find it hard to fault the logic of Mark Coray, from the National Hairdressers Federation, who says: If youre reducing the power its taking longer so the client is unhappy, but if youre reducing the power youre holding the dryer for longer so theyre using the same amount of energy anyway. Quite.
Were often told that the EU is not an issue for most people, that voters place it ninth or tenth on their list of concerns, well behind education, the economy and immigration. But it all comes down to how we phrase the question.
If by the EU, we mean what happens in Brussels, then we shouldnt be surprised that people arent especially exercised about it. Yes, they may say, its corrupt, its expensive, its undemocratic, but it doesnt have the same impact on my life that, say, the state of the local school has.
The trouble is that, as this ban shows, the EU doesnt confine itself to Brussels. It affects almost everything we do.
Brussels is methodically working its way through our homes, proscribing any household machines that are deemed to use too much electricity
The rigmarole you have to go through to open a bank account, having to bring along all your old utilities bills? Thats the EUs Money Laundering Directive. The fiddling around to find the right stamp for different sizes of envelopes? The Postal Services Directive. The end of weekly bin collections? The Landfill Directive.
My point is not that the EU is always wrong. Its that its crazy to decide these things at a continental level.
I am required by law, for example, to ferry my children around in car-seats until they reach the age of 12. I had been looking forward to discarding the wretched yogurt-encrusted blobs much earlier (the car-seats, I mean, not the children). You might think I have a point, or you might find me an irresponsible father.
Either way, where is the cross-border dimension? How did we reach the stage where such a rule was imposed uniformly on 500 million people? Cant we determine such matters through our own democratic procedures?
This isnt really about vacuum cleaners. It isnt about carbon emissions. It isnt even about the lobbying power of large corporations in Brussels. Its about freedom.
If someone wants to sell you something and you want to buy it, the authorities should have a very good reason to come between you. It may be a small matter  a trivial matter, really, compared to some of the abominations the EU is responsible for  but every such erosion reduces us as a people.
