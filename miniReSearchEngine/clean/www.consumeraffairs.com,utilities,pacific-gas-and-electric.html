My power usage skyrocketed to astronomical amounts 2 Saturday mornings in a row between 1 and 6 am. Both nights there was a motor home parked in front of our apartments and we noticed the smart meters directly next to our front door were tampered with. My bill for that 400 sq. ft, one bedroom apartment was always $30 plus or minus a few bucks for over 4 years I lived there and suddenly I received a 14 day notice that's almost $200 when my bill had a credit of $3.88, then shortly after I received a bill double that and numerous times have pleaded for an investigation while they say they will do and it never happens. I had to pay half of it off because after being homeless for a month with 2 kids we finally got a place and had to put it in our name.
Now I get a new bill saying I owe an almost $200 deposit all for something I don't do and you flat out don't give a damn about your customers, hard working families that struggle paycheck to paycheck. My bill shows that I used more kw of power in those 2.5 hour windows than in the whole year and PG&E Said that's impossible. This is an injustice and I'm tired of getting robbed left and right. Life is hard enough and I want to prosecute to the full extent of the law when they figure this out. I tried to get photos of the motor homes license plate because a powerful order indicated drug manufacturing but every time I tried the motor home would start and move to a different corner trying to obstruct my view. Please help me.

PG&E charges more on gas delivery charges than the actual gas cost from Tiger gas company. I'm wondering why.

My husband moved out in 2012 and kept the PGE bill to our house in his name. PGE wouldn't allow me to change the account, or even add myself to the account even though I am co-owner of house and have been for 10 years. My Ex stopped paying the bills I guess, and I started getting letters to "Tenant" about late account. When I called they wouldn't talk to me as it's not my account! My Ex had over $800 he tried transferring to me but the account was still in his name. Today without sending me a bill. So I have no account number and no amount due, they turned off my power.
I homeschool two Children, and we have no lights, no heat, our food is going bad, the garage door won't open, we can't get water as it's electric dispenser, our fish are suffering, and we can't charge our cell phones or use the internet. I am sending this from my running car in the garage. We are cold and this is so sad that in America a country thought to be so advanced, that this has to happen to a stay-at-home Mom whose Husband has decided to starve her and her Children out. PGE is therefore contributing to the abuse and neglect of a Father who is already in contempt of court and a negligent Father.

I moved into an apt approximately 700sq ft, from a 1425sqft house, my first electric bill for apt is $500.00, my bill for house was never over $200.00, we have the same appliances and haven't changed habits. Outraged to say the least. One day I noticed my neighbor, yes we are connected by one wall, who moved in at same time had no meter, is getting electrical power. Informed PGE and they said it would be looked into, no one ever came out to check and PGE said our bill was high because they of AC unit running. They won't do anything about our neighbors stealing electricity and now I have a $1,000.00 bill I cannot pay.

A PG&E tree contractor (Wright Tree Service who sub contracted Mario's Tree Service) topped an oak tree on our neighbor's property near power lines on 8/19/14 and accessed the area via our property. They were unable to get their trucks and chipper back up our driveway - leaving skid marks and causing extensive damage to the driveway surface and sides of the driveway along a 4500 square foot section of asphalt. We now need a retaining wall built where they drove their chipper and heavy box truck off our driveway, damaging the hillside below the driveway. A 2500 square foot section of our soccer field that they used as a work area needs to be repaired. They also damaged flagstone, a fruit tree, and a retaining wall. They drove past 2 private property signs and a "no vehicles beyond this point" sign.
Workers were arguing loudly on our property for roughly an hour as they attempted to get their vehicles back up our driveway. Cigarette butts were found on our soccer field after they left. We have been unable to use our soccer field since the incident as a result of the damage. We have been demanding that PG&E cover the cost of repairs for over 4 months now. They referred the claim to Wright Tree Service who then sent us a settlement agreement on 12/2/14 to only cover 20% of the repair costs. It has been over 4 months since the incident and there has still been no resolution. We have received several inches of rain since the incident which has served to make the damage worse.
PG&E has absolutely no sense of urgency to resolve this matter. We were livid on the day of the incident as a result of the complete disregard for our property. We are now 10x more angry as a result of PG&E's unwillingness to do the right thing and cover the cost to repair the damage that their contracted workers caused out of negligence. This tree wasn't even on our property, yet we are suffering the consequences of PG&E's decision to hire incompetent contractors.

PGE is stating they are basing the customer's deposit amount on the person that lived in the residence before. They take the amount owed and double it. How is this fair to the person moving in. Why are we paying the debt of the previous person living in that residence? This cannot be OK.

In the Bakersfield office whenever we go inside to pay our bill there is never a place for handicap people to pay a cashier. Handicap people have to stand in the long lines to pay. There is only one chair for anyone to sit in. When there are 50 or more people in line there is no way we can wait. There is a booth for handicaps but no one there. Please help.

I called last Thursday 09/25/2014 PG&E to pay my bill of $8.16 and I got overcharged on my bank account $81.41. The lady who I spoke asked me to repeat my bank account and I did repeat. Then she hung up on me without giving me a confirmation number. I immediately went to check my bank account online. I saw that she overcharged me. I have been on the phone since Thursday trying to solve this problem that PG&E made. PG&E said they can reimburse me but it will take 15 days and I don't have only PG&E bill; I have other bills. Now PG&E said the fastest way to get my money to not being penalized on my other bills is to talk to my bank directly and see if they can credit me back my money which I did go the very next day. The customer service from Golden One at the branch when we called with the personal banker said that it usually takes 10 days but she would do everything in her power to do it Friday or at the latest Monday.
Now Monday is here. I got off from work and I don't see my money back on pending. Between Friday and now I had spoken to this lady from PG&E who said once my bank reimburse me the payment she will credit my account for $50. Another agent from PG&E had said she feel so bad and she will make sure she follows up with me on Monday because Friday she was off. Monday comes. None of these ladies had called me to follow up neither the personal banker. At this point I am tired. PG&E stole my money and don't want to give it back at an appropriate time for me to not being penalizing on my other bills and rent. I will have to take legal action and take it to the law. I see all these complaints about PG&E and nobody is doing anything about these thieves.
Today I made my decision. They will not reimburse me $81.41 but they will have to pay for all my inconveniences and it will be more than that. They are not professional at all. If you are looking for a job and you cannot do your job right, don't apply just for you to pay your bills. This is people bank information you are dealing with. All of them agent or supervisors are incompetent people. That's being said, PG&E or Citibank will have to deal with my lawyer.

The wind knock down my tree and cause a power outage. By the time the PG&E crew came out they didn't even ask me that much question. They went to ask my neighbor who was a tree cutter and that ** told them that I was cutting my tree which wasn't true. I told the PG&E guy that the wind knock down the limb of the tree which cause it to hit the power line and cause the power outage. Now they say that I have to pay 11 thousand for the damaged that was due to mother nature. I feel that is so pathetic. They came out only one time to trim my tree 2 feet from the main power line and I called them about 3 time about the tree being in the power line and now they want me to pay 11 thousand for a damaged that was cause by Mother Nature smfh.

I went to the office on H St. in Bakersfield, CA and they told me it was going to take 48 hrs to start service. I said, "Do you know how hot it is? Let me talk to your supervisor." I wait 10 min then **, the supervisor, had a attitude and said oh well, I created the problem by not calling in when I moved in. My father just passed away. I totally forgot and he said with a smirk on his face, "Not our problem." What kind of a person is he? Has anyone else had problems with him? I think he's racist. I called the customer service. The girl and her supervisor were awesome. They really do take the time to help their customers. ** should be fired.

On April 7, 2014 I made a $200 payment to PGE using my Citibank debit card. My payment was authorized and an authorization number was given. When my May 2014 bill arrived the $200 payment was not reflected. I called PGE, talked to Fresno call center and they stated they did not receive the payment. I called Citibank, they confirmed payment was processed and paid out to PGE on April 9, 2014. I again called PGE talked to Fresno call center, was again told that PGE did not accept the $200 payment. I told a supervisor I had bank statements from Citibank printed out. Statements showed $201.25 coming out of my checking. I am now starting to go crazy.
I again called PGE call center in Fresno. I now spoke with a different supervisor, Nick. He gave me his fax number to fax my bank stmts to him. He promised once he received them my PGE acct. would be credited. He never called me back on June 5th. Weeks went by I never received any word from Nick, supervisor out of Fresno. TODAY, July 16th, 2014, went to PGE office in Roseville, CA. What a joke. Am I living in the USA or a third world country? I was told that they did not have a supervisor to help me, they would not even look at my Citibank statement and would not credit my account. I can't believe they did not even care. The female working told me all she could do was to fax the papers back to Nick. The PGE office did not make copies of my statements, did not care the $200. Payment was made.
I asked her why everyone at the call center both Fresno and Sacramento call center said their office would help me. I feel like they are all brain dead. They could have made a 3 way call to my bank. Plus my bank statements all proof payment was made. This has been going on for 4 months. What is their problem? Who is in charge??? THEY will not give me credit. What do I do? They do nothing but lie. They are not honest, not right they take our money stealing and getting away. Not to mention all the stress. I am a correctional nurse with a severe work injury. I don't have an extra $200 to give them for free. They told me today they would be shutting off my power. Fine let them. They also have my deposit. They are like the insurance companies. All crooks.

I left my now ex-husband Jan 2010 - contacted PG&E regarding my account. I was told there was a past due amount and that I needed to have a zero balance before I could remove my name from the account. I was paying weekly to get myself unassisted with the account. Finally July 2010 I called and was then told I could not remove my name off the account since I was the primary. I told them to shut it off then; it was no longer my problem. I recently discovered they are saying I owe 568.00 from 2011 at an address I had not lived at for a year and a half. I called and all I could get from PG&E was Oh well you owe. UMM, no I don't. I have proof from DMV etc. that I did not live there and I am not paying any more of my idiot ex-husband bills. Because PG&E did not do their job, it's not my problem. I cannot believe they cannot even step up and admit there may have been a mistake. What person in their right mind would pay an ex-spouses utility bills for a year and a half??

I was using PG&E service from last 1 year. I do not have any electrical equipment of mine except one TV and one laptop. I never had my bill in last 12 months greater than $70 but last month I got $306 bill. I was totally surprised. Even after calling their customer support they have only one reason to say - its my usage. Their customer representative giving me the example I may be ran my refrigerator for 24 hrs. But its not the unusual thing which I did. I am running it continuously from last 12 months. Even something went wrong it could double my bill but it could not be 5 times. Appreciate any suggestion, how I can go against it and get the justice. Living in a small one bedroom with my wife and paying $306 as electricity bill cannot be acceptable in any circumstances.

I've lived in my house for 14+ years. Last December (2013) I received a card in my mailbox saying PG&E couldn't read my meter. I called the phone number and left them messages on 3 separate occasions. Nobody called back. My December bill came in at $79, which is very low for winter. When my January 2014 bill arrived, it was $284. It turns out that PG&E performed an "estimated" meter read for my December bill. Somehow this estimation was about the lowest of the year, despite it being winter. When the meter was actually read in January, PG&E billed me the entire difference between the (ridiculously low) December estimated read and the actual read all in a single month's billing cycle. That put me well into Tier 3 and Tier 4 prices. This caused an overcharge of well over $100 when I hadn't used any more gas or electricity than normal. I think PG&E is doing this intentionally. All they need to claim is that they couldn't access your meter and then estimate the reading low. It's sandbagging. It's illegal.

I switched to another gas supplier out of TX. My gas bill was $88.00 but PG&E also charged me a $91.00 "delivery charge"!! When I called PG&E, I was told it was cost for gas line maintenance. This doesn't seem right. How can the maintenance be more than product??? And how could it cost $91.00 a month???

The subject should be addressed in these issues. I moved into a two bedroom town home at the start of the summer, which I understand usually rates for the summer can be high if you have numerous fans, or an AC unit with a high demand. Well none of these are the case in my issue as we have no AC and would occasionally have one small fan in a window for an hour at best. How is it my very first bill from these bastards was over 400 dollars (200 hundred for the deposit, then another 230 for the bill) as my wife is a stay at home mother, I assumed she was doing something to warrant these ungodly bills.
So after making a few modifications around our home our bill for the next month dropped to 218, again... What the hell could we be doing wrong? So I did as most people on here have done. We had a technician come out to explain a bunch of mumbo jumbo that still makes no sense. He pointed out we have all electric appliances, but I just moved from Los Angeles where again we had all electric appliances, used far more electricity and our bills averaged between 30-60 dollars/ monthly. I've heard that PG&E is attempting to recoup its losses from the huge lawsuit they recently paid out, well PG&E... "Your mistake should not be passed on to the end users. If I make a mistake, I own up to it apologize, make it right then I move on with my life.
It seems with these so called "Smart Meters" you've found a way to scam the end users. I pray the justice system is swift once this all comes to light and your executives our put out in the cold. As it stands currently I have yet to have a bill below $200 dollars despite not using most of my appliance, unplugging everything imaginable and still trying to keep a small child, my wife and I comfortable. Someone needs to do something about this company, and fast!!!

House was taken over with false order of protection, while fighting the court to get house back, because I wasn't there to get mail and pay. My PG&E power was turned off. So the house thieves steal the power. Four days later, judge gives me back my house and an hour later PG&E is there checking on a call. They cut power for theft and give $1200.00 fine and the $600.00 for the bill. I gave them copies of restraining showing I could not have done this. I was a victim. They would help me. The power being off helped them to steal almost everything I ever owned. Now disabled and on fixed income, cant start over and soon to be homeless. Do I need a lawyer and how would I pay him if I did. Any answers let me know. Thanks. Worried.

Recently, I participated in PG&E's weatherization program. I was told that they would be providing me with weatherstripping on my windows and doors as well as checking for gas leaks; possibly repairing a few cracks in windows as well. Most of the technicians sent out were fairly decent. They told me that they were going to schedule a technician for me to REPAIR a minor gas leak I had in my water heater pipe. When the technician arrived, he basically told me he could not repair it because it involved actual skilled work, like soldering, and that he couldn't simply turn a wrench to fix it so there was too much effort involved, and that "for my safety", he was going to have to shut off my gas until I got it fixed. Nothing of mine was ever weatherized and no window cracks were ever fixed. I had two lights replaced in my ceiling; which I didn't really need. Lesson learned: Don't count on PG&E to help you, instead, count on them to regulate your "safety" by cutting off your utilities. TL;DR PG&E misled me about getting a repair and instead sent out a "safety technician" to shut off my gas.

In October, we moved into our home. When we contacted PG&E to transfer service to our name, we were told that there was a bill from the previous occupant that needed to be dealt with. Well, the previous occupant is deceased; I know this because she was my adopted sister. I tried to explain this to the agent, but got nowhere. Several times I attempted this. Fast forward to two weeks ago and 16 bills come to my house addressed to my dead sisters boyfriend. So I take all the bills and my lease agreement down to the local office. Finally, I think I'm getting somewhere. The person is less than pleasant, telling me I should have come in 7 months ago. I didn't know what to do 7 months ago!
In the meantime, they send a field agent to my house to shut off my service. The lady was nice when I told her I was waiting for PG&E to verify that I actually live in my house. She left the power on and said she would wait. Two days later, I get a call from the verification dept. telling me that I'm verified and that I have 24 hours to come up with $1,800 or I would be shut off. They say I have been using $400-600 a month in services! I'm told I can't see the bill, dispute the bill or anything until I pay them. I can't get help from any agencies because the bill isn't in my name. No other company is allowed to do this to their customers and we have no choice but to either pay up or sit in the dark like me.

The only things that run on PGE in my home are the lights and the water heater - which is turned down to a low temperature. The month of December, my bill was double what it has ever been, claiming that we had a higher usage than ever before. Last year, at this time, our water heater was significantly higher and we had a house mate and our usage was less. Both of my neighbors said that their bills were also double for the month of December, stating that it was outrageous and no idea why it was any higher than ever before. Something is not right about this. I wish that we could all come together and fight this.

Since 2009, our bill from PG&E has been excessive. They installed a smart meter and did test to see how well the house weatherized. The summer of 2009, our bill was over $1,500.00. There are only two people who live in the home; this is one of three homes (triplex). I know we need to pay our bills, but when you can't explain my bill tripled or even went up 4 times the amount, I'm concerned we are now facing a 48-hour notice to be turned off. Our bill now is over $3,000.00. There are still only two people who live in the home. Please help.

If I were to fill your order for a dozen Grade AA eggs and then charge you $100 for those eggs, you would probably complain. After hearing your complaint, I might nod knowingly and reduce the price to $20.00. That is 80% off the initial bill, but you would probably still be unhappy. Eventually, I might grudgingly reduce the price another ten dollars. You should be thrilled and grateful to pay only $10 for a carton of eggs since that is 90% off of what I originally charged you. The fact that everyone else pays only $2 for those same dozen eggs should be of no concern to you. As ludicrous as the above scenario sounds, that is precisely what PG&E is doing with my billing. The letter CPUC sent me seems to be based on incomplete information PG&E gave them (surprise, surprise!). Because the meter readings were skewed, it is vital that following information be provided and understood.
I had a credit of $60 at the beginning of the timeline (7/8/11 - 3/10/12) in question. Documentation, provided by PG&E, clearly states that I paid out over $2,490 during that same time period , which was still not enough to support the life style of PG&E executives (or to pay for the lawsuits) so they wanted even more money. My home is approximately 950 square feet. The hot water is gas. The central heating is gas. The stove is gas. The gas meter remained consistent with past gas billings averaging $30 a month, higher in the winter, lower in the summer as is to be expected. There are no space heaters in this house. The light bulbs are all florescent except for the icebox and the stove. There is no outdoor lighting except for the front and back porch. There is a computer and two TVs. The light switches are motion-activated and shut off five minutes if there is no detected motion in the room. I run the dishwasher about once a week and the washer once or twice a week. I rarely use the electric dryer as I have a solar-powered dryer, which works fine when the sun is shining. I live alone but spend many evenings with my girlfriend, usually watching movies on a 32 television set.
I explained all of this to PG&E countless times, yet they seemed stuck on reading faulty data provided by a malfunctioning meter. They did not seem to find it remarkable that a small house (that was using gas for half of its energy needs) was being charged $1,500 a month for three months running. I understand that PG&E must get calls every day from customers who are convinced their meter is faulty because their bill went up fifty dollars two months in a row, but my situation was radically different. I implored them to send a tech to look at the meter in December 2010. Instead of dispatching a technician, they sent yet another meter-reader. Now, PG&E was getting a reading from the regular meter-reader, the new meter-reader, and me, reporting over the phone what the current kilowatts were up to. Not surprisingly, the fact that three people were reading the meter instead of just one did nothing to solve the problem. It took PG&E nearly five months to send someone out to check the health of the meter.
In the meantime, I had been sending PG&E $300 (well over what it should have been, as the newly installed meter would later confirm) about every month in good faith until the issue was resolved. As a sign of their good faith, PG&E turned off my power. I proceeded to go through three tiers of PG&E management pleading my case. All three customer representatives, just like all the representatives before them, asked me the same questions. No, I do not use space heaters. My heating is gas, as is my stove, hot water heater, etc. The third manager I spoke with was, well, she was there to protect PG&Es interests and nothing else. We had an extended conversation, and I provided her with all the facts that are listed in this letter (gas heater, etc.)
My PG&E bill had ballooned to $9,000, and she told me - I kid you not - that although there might be a problem with the meter (ya think?), there was no way of knowing until the meter was turned back on, and the meter could not be turned back on until I paid the past due balance. This person was more of a tough negotiator than a customer rep, but she finally agreed to turn the meter on after I coughed up a thousand dollars, about the same amount of money as an annual electric bill in a house this size. This was on top of the $1,200 I had already paid PG&E. The technician finally tested the old meter in late May. By their own admission, the meter had been malfunctioning, spinning over twelve times faster than it should have been. No one knows how long the fifty-five-year- old meter had been giving excessive readings, but they had been getting progressively higher for some time. The only times my bills were remotely reasonable is when I spent a lot of time away from home, leaving just the refrigerator running and the heat (gas) on low for my orchids.
There is no doubt, after looking at the old bills and comparing them with the bills Ive received since the new meter went in, that I have been charged many thousands of dollars for power that was never delivered because the old meter hadnt worked properly in years. I thought with great relief that this ordeal was over once the PG&E technician confirmed what I had known for about five months. Naturally, I was expecting a hefty refund. Instead, the first adjustment put forth from the service rep was $1,300 off my $12,000 bill, case closed. When I asked for the name of the technician and how I could get hold of him, PG&E refused to give me his name (!). They went on to say that they didnt know (!?) how to find him. I said I felt forced to go public with the facts (an option I am still likely to pursue), and it was shortly after that that PG&E reduced the balance, though the amount owed was still far more than it should have been.
During the period from 7/8/11 to 3/10/12, I paid PG&E $2,490 and was fully expecting a refund after PG&Es own man measured the meter and found that it was running 12.3 times faster than it should have been. Once PG&E removed the meter and had it in their possession, they backtracked and said their own technician was "mistaken" and the meter was only "slightly off". Instead of a refund, PG&E demanded an additional $872.61, which I am currently paying off in monthly installments on top of my regular bill under the threat of PG&E unplugging me unless I maintain payments. This brings to a total of $3.362.61 I am paying PG&E for an 8-month period in this tiny, green home, which is over $400 a month! Therefore, when I read the CPUCs letter describing PG&Es additional charges of $872.61 on top of the absurdly excessive $2,490 already collected as favorable, I have to respectfully disagree. PG&E is basing their billing on historical usage using inflated readings from a faulty meter that favors PG&E in a big way.
After replacing their old meter at my home with their new smart meter, my electrical readings plummeted, yet PG&E insisted on continuing to charge me excessive prices (for the seven-month period prior to the smart meters installation) based on, by their own admission, a faulty electrical meter. Of course, the important question is obvious - Does the new meter PG&E installed reflect $400 per month? It does not. It is about $100 per month for both Gas and Electric, keeping in line with the other houses on my street (finally!). I would be most grateful if the CPUC would estimate a reasonable adjustment so that I might recover a portion of the fortune PG&E has been overpaid over the two-year period (at least) prior to the Smart Meter installation in addition to the seven-month period this letter has specifically addressed. It has been five weeks since I sent the CPUC this documentation and I have still not heard back from them. Regardless of whatever the outcome is of my fight against PG&E's fearless extortion, I strongly urge that everyone check their meters accuracy.
Here's how. Take a meter reading after shutting off all electricity in your home. On the most convenient circuit, plug in a 500-watt halogen light for two hours. Make sure the halogen light is the only load running on that circuit. If the reading at the end of two hours is greater than one kilowatt, you've got a defective meter giving PG&E excessive readings. Whether that's by design or not, you'll have to decide. Or, hire a qualified electrician - notarize document his findings. Notarized documentation by certified professionals is the only effective weapon you have against PG&E. Never assume that they will correct their mistakes if it means less money for their bloated bottom line. Always record conversations with anyone from PG&E and keep copies of any and all correspondence. Sadly, most people (like me) learn this too late, and the corruption and greed continues to fester and grow since the company is nearly untouchable.
If you have ever wondered why PG&E spends tens of millions of dollars on advertising and PR (since they are essentially a monopoly- What company will you buy your power from if PG&E shuts off your juice?), it's because they don't want too many people begin to question their billing practices. When you don't want people to see your dirt or how deep it runs, you plant flowers. The price of hiring a professional for a couple of hours may prove to be the best investment you make if you have a legitimate issue with PG&E. If you leave it up to PG&E to correct any kind of overbilling you've incurred, you might as well be spitting in the wind.

PG&E is a scam. July, I received a $203 bill. I decided I wasn't going to use my AC anymore to keep bill down. August, I received a $302 bill. I immediately called up customer support to dispute. I informed them that it wasn't possible to have this bill when I knew the energy consumption went down from the previous month, yet I received a bill for 50% more. Sept. was $174. Still too high being that I still wasn't using my AC. I was anticipating around $75-$100. October came in at $63. This seems more accurate. November went up to $87.
What the ** is going on with their billing? When I disputed, they sent out a reader to test my SMART reader and it was labeled as within boundaries for accuracy. It was within 1/2% margin of error or something. If that is the case, how can it be that I am seeing such a major fluctuation in my bills when I was monitoring usage so closely? This seems to be a scam from a monopoly. The representative told me the impact will be that their readings are showing spikes in the middle of the day when the AC turns on. Disregard that I am not using my AC and my thermostat has it turned off. This is a SMART reader. It seems like it provides reading based on anticipated usage and varies it, to make it look like it doesn't follow directly with any trends.
This is ridiculous. If I want to remove the SMART meter, they will charge $75 and a $10 service fee by the state of California. I hope more people start calling these guys out. This is a joke how they can get away with this.

At some point in the last two months, PG&E installed a SmartMeter without my permission. Now the last two months, my power bill has gone from a norm of $86 to $100 to $830 for Sept. and I just got the Oct. bill for $1,151. When I got the 830 dollar bill, I went to the office to get things fixed. After 1/2 hour of answering questions, the person told me I should hear back from someone in three weeks or so. Now I have this new bill of $1,151 that there is no way I could ever pay for. I need help with this. I plan on going to the office again in the morning first thing. But in the meantime, I sit and worry to the point that it's making me sick.

We have frequent power outages in our area. In July, we had an outage that caused my air-conditioner to burn out. The company that replaced it (at a cost of $2,500) stated that PG&E should be responsible since the unit was only 5 years old and problem caused by the outage. I contacted PG&E and they refused assistance, stating that the outage could have been caused by an "act of God" such as a bird, etc. and since they did not cause the outage deliberately, they were not responsible.

Well, I was part of the Balanced Payment Plan with PG&E for quite a while since my bill was going up and it made sense back then. On July 1st, 2012, I transferred 50% of my electricity consumption to Marin Clean Energy (MCE) for the sake of the environment, but my bill went from $221 to $251. The $31 increase is due to the 50% cost of electricity from MCE. So, I decided to check the bill to realize that my actual bill was around $89 in the past months, and PG&E never contacted me to tell me that the BPP wasn't working anymore since I don't use that much energy anymore and they were promoting smart meters and efficient use of energy; it was all a scam to put you to sleep, they just want to beef up profit and make you pay for the San Bruno Gas Pipe Disaster. But guess what, I called MCE and transferred all my energy consumption (100% solar) to them. I love competition!

PG&E won't restore power for my property located on ** Milpitas, CA 95035. I tried to settle them with the past due amount that was owed on the property by the previous home owner. Because of this problem, I have been forced to use generators as a second source of electricity. Please help me. PG&E only wants to deal with the previous owner and I don't know where he is. Thank you.

On 11/18/11, PG&E sent me a letter informing me that they had discovered that I was being billed Oakland's utility tax rate incorrectly. My business is in Emeryville. They gave me a contact person (George **) with the City of Oakland and he sent me a form to fill out to get a refund. I filled out the form, provided the documentation, and received a check back for one year of the 8 years that they had overcharged. He (George) told me that the statute of limitations on this is one year. I received my refund check for $277.66. Extrapolating from that, my refund amount would be a minimum of another $2000, probably more, for the remaining years.
It seems odd to me that PG&E is not taking responsibility and re-collecting the taxes from Oakland and that there would be a statute of limitations on something like this. My bills simply say "utility tax" without identifying for what city the tax is collected. My understanding of statutes of limitations is that there is an implication that one knew about the problem, which I did not.
I have asked Mr. ** in a voice mail left today to provide me with the citation in code for his assertion that the statute of limitations limits my recovery. I have so far received nothing, but I hope that he will comply. If not, I will call again in hope of speaking with him directly. Everyone involved, especially Mr. **, has been polite, but I feel stonewalled regarding this money. What right does Oakland have to keep it?

I have an approximately 600 square foot loft and I've been living here for about 1.5 years. Usually my bill is approximately $60-$90 and even during the summer a maximum of $120 or so. Well this past July, I got a bill for about $280 and my AC was off because it was broke for about a week and the PG&E representative insisted that it has been running non-stop. So I didn't argue with him because he was giving me the run around saying maybe there was a glitch in my AC unit or something which wasn't the case, I know it.
So I decided in August I would go out to the mall or some other place with AC to hang out while it was hot, so I didn't have to use my AC. I ended up getting another $300 bill. Once again, there was nothing I could do because he insisted that it shows all my usage online, etc. Now, we're in winter, I run my heater every night and my bill is back down to $50.
I feel so helpless against PG&E and I know they are scamming people or raising their rates but since they are the only energy company, it's like you can't argue with them even though there are large gaps between summer and winter bills. All they have to say is, "well, it's summer time so you're using your ac more" and even though I explain to him I don't even touch the damn thermostat. It's not like he can come to my house and witness for himself that I'm not using my AC, you know?
PG&E is a tyrant company. If they are collecting $400 from everybody during the summer that's a scam. How much is the CEO getting paid? If my bill is $200 per month, that better be going to finding more resources, not a CEO having a billion dollar salary.
