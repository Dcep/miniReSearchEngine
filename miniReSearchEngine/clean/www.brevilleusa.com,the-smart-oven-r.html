Worst Electric Product
"This is the workst electric product I have ever seen. The reliability of the setting is very poor. My first Smart Oven died just after a year. William Sonoma replaced it but the process took months to complete.
The one they replaced it with it died with a poof and spark.
Both William Sonoma and Breville are offering me discounts to buy a new one. I would not buy this or any Breville product ever. They are stylish but the performance is overrated and the quality is dismal. "

Short Life
"I loved my little convection oven but after only two years to the day it completely died.  I used it for toasting and to roast potatoes and side dishes and smaller cuts of meat like pork loin.  I never used the broiler.
One day the panel went out.  After ruling out issues with the outlet, etc., a quick search of the internet revealed that this is a common problem with this product.  Since I was beyond the warranty, Breville could not replace it.   I think two years is too little life span for a $300 product and it seems like this was not an anomaly but a common problem.  I'll try another brand now as I like having a back up oven."

Great when it works
"I purchased my oven two years ago.  At the time we really loved it, but after only 60 days it started posting an error message any time we tried to use it for anything but toasting.  I tried to get on line support but got so frustrated trying to get help I gave up and started using as a very large and expensive toaster.
Once in a while I think maybe it will work and try to bake or broil someting.  Sometimes it works for  a few minutes but usually it errors before it reaches temperature.
Tonight I decided I need to write a review since I once more tried to heat a lof of bread but it was futile.  I am now looking for a toaster as I picked the unit up and tossed it into the dumpster in our complex.
For those of you who were lucky enough to get one of these that has worked reliably I congratulate you.  For those I see with the same issues I had I sympathize."

Wonderful little oven
"This little oven is totally awesome!! I guess really the only fault I find with this oven is that there is no light inside. I have to shine a flashlight inside just to see how the food is doing. Maybe on the next oven they'll add an inside light!"

OK But needs Improvement
"It doesn't self clean, grates are like old-timey-grill-racks extremely hard to clean. Grates need the heat resistant covering for easier cleaning. The oven is not tall enough to rise bread in and bake it...I guess they want you to buy their bread makers. Other than those two major flaws it is an excellent oven."

Best Toaster Oven Ever!
"We have had this toaster oven for 10+ years. No problems. Works great! The ONLY thing is we wish it was SELF CLEANING as it is hard to clean inside the walls from cooked on food spatter. The rack is dishwasher safe too when wiped dry. The crumb tray is easy to clean and we put in a liner and clean it after every use. We use it for toasted breads, casseroles, roasted chicken, 13" or less homemade or frozen pizza, breaded & non breaded fish & seafood, baked potatoes, stuffed peppers, cakes, cookies, bars, roasted duck, scalloped potatoes, broiled burgers, baked mac n cheese, roasted vegetables, pies, homemade breads, buns - ALMOST anything you cook in a regular oven. We used for a year in our Class A RV instead of oven in RV because it didn't cook as evenly as this oven does. Doesn't heat up the house as much as a regular oven does and cooks MUCH faster, using MUCH less energy. It has been through NUMEROUS power outages and still worked when electricity was restored. (We NOW have it on a safety breaker.) Can use a no handles 9 X 13 pan with high sides for lasagna, stuffed peppers.  Be careful not too high. Cover with foil if too close to top. It has 3 levels for pans used, and baking, roasting, toast, or broiling. Love that it turns off after timer goes off, UNLIKE my expensive Professional JennAire Oven. We usually buy a toaster oven every 3 years so we have come out WAY AHEAD this time in what we spent. THANKS BREVILLE! LOVE YOUR PRODUCT!!!"

A Great Product But Delicate
"I love this oven.  It's a perfect alternative for baking smaller items, pies, one layer or loaf cakes, small meatloaves, potatoes, etc.  It operates just like another oven so it toasts and broils as well.
I purchased one two years ago.  The element broke (on its own, no provoking), and the oven was replaced under warranty.  Now 18 months, the replacement oven quit working.  There was no warning or issues, just worked one day, the next, none of its functions were working.  It appeared as if it had been unplugged; not even the digital reading came on. When I called to have it repaired, it would be $99 for the repair, or it would be replaced for that if it could not be repaired, plus I had to box it up and return it.
I liked the oven well enough to purchase another one, but this is the last straw.  The Hamilton Beach I just gave to my nephew was still working after  7 years."

Won't get another
"Purchased BOV800XL several years ago (3-4).  Used primarily for toaster and normal oven (timed) functions.  Unit failed (complete failure - no functions worked) while under warranty and was replaced gratis shipping was included.  The second unit has now failed (started as toaster would or would not work - timer did but heating elements did not then bake quit too).  It is well out of warranty and more than a year since replacement.  Contacted support and they checked my registration of the product to verify it was out of warranty.  Was offered standard repair rate (think it was $125 and pay shipping in) or with, I think, 90 day warranty pr new unit at 30% off and shipping included, full one year warranty.  With two complete failures of the in what I feel is an unreasonably short time I do not see any reason to send more money to Breville.  This was our first Breville product and it will be our last."

Can't say enough good about Breville
"We purchased one of these units about 5 years ago and used it everyday, often several times. It never came up short in terms of what we asked it to cook.
When its door spring failed recently, Breville replaced the complete unit with a refurbished one. They even covered the costs of shipping back the old one back. From the time we asked for the return label unto the new unit was in our home was just about a week.
Thanks Breville!"
