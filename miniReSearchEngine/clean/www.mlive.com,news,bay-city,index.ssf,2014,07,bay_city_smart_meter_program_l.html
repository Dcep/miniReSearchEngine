Bay City smart meter rollout leaves residents with plumbing bills, concerns and questions
Bay City replacing residential water meters
Mark Niernberg points out the water meter at his Bay City home Thursday, July 10. Nierenberg opted to not sign a waiver to have a third-party vendor replace his water meter, fearing that his water system might break. Bay City contracted Utility Partners of America to replace about 35,000 water meters across the city with new, "smart meters." If a meter needs to be completely replaced, the company is having residents sign a waiver saying the company isn't responsible for any damages. (Yfat Yossifor | The Bay City Times)

BAY CITY, MI
 Bay City officials say the switch to electronic "smart meters" for the city's electric and water utilities makes operations more efficient and provides more usage transparency to residents.
But as the $6.8 million program continues to roll out, it has caused headaches and expensive plumbing bills for some residents.
Terry Basmadjian,who lives on Bay City's West Side, said she paid $160 to have a plumber replace a valve that broke when her meter was swapped out last week. Mark Niernberg, fearing he would have to pay a similar, or higher, bill, opted against switching his meter out for now, as the installer requires residents to sign a waiver saying the company isn't liable for any damages during the install.
"I'm all for the new meters, but if they switch this out, I'll likely have to hire a plumber to fix it," Niernberg said. "If I have a plumber come out and update my water lines, and then the city comes in to install the meter, and something breaks, I would need to pay to have a plumber come out again and fix it. I think this whole notion that the homeowner is responsible is ridiculous."
City officials are now looking into these issues to ensure the estimated 15,000 water meters can be installed by year's end without costing customers hundreds of dollars.
"As of now, I've only heard of one formal complaint," said Bay City Manager Rick Finn. "But I've been told there are some concerns about the process. We need to look into this more before we make any decisions on if we need to make some changes."

Problems with the install
When Terry Basmadjian signed the waiver, she didn't realize it included a sentence that said she would be liable for any damages that could occur during the installation process.
"I just thought they needed my permission to start the work," she said. Basmadjianis the step-mother to Bay City Commissioner Kerice Basmadjian, 7th Ward.
Terry Basmadjianrealized the water valve was broken when the installer tried to turn water back on after swapping the meter. It was likely the first time the valve had been turned off since moving into the residence, she said.
"The installer then told me his company isn't responsible because I signed the waiver," Basmadjian said.
After a $160 visit from Bay City-based Doug's Plumbing, her valve was replaced.
Bob Dion, the city's water distribution metering supervisor, said the city has received about a dozen calls per day from residents who experienced a brokenvalve as a result of the smart meter install.
"These are old houses, and many of them haven't exercised their valves ever," he said. "They've never been turned off, which is why they break easily."
As a result, a resident ends up hiring a plumber that can cost up to hundreds of dollars.
Doug Trerice, owner of Doug's Plumbing, said his company has replaced about 100 valves since the water meter swaps started.
Trerice said older valves are made of brass, which is more susceptible to rust than modern valves, which are made of a stronger type of alloy with Kaplan coating.
"We've definitely been busy during this switch," he said.
Trerice recommends residents exercise their valves at least once per year.
"When you turn them off, though, do it slowly," he said. "When you turn it back on, also do it very slowly."
Upcoming solution?
Terry Kilburn, the city's water and sewer supervisor, said some residents have paid "several" hundreds of dollars to plumbers to have their valves repaired, as a result of the smart meter rollout, prompting the city to act swiftly and find a solution.
He says the city is looking into creating a program that would give residents a list of local plumbers to replace the valves. Under the proposed plan, plumbers would submit a bid for the cost of a valve replacement, Kilburn said, and become an approved vendor of the city.
"Residents would be more comfortable if we can say, here's a plumber and here's how much it's going to cost, instead of telling them to just call a plumber," Kilburn said.
The resident would still pay for the valve replacement, Kilburn said.
"This is something that's at the top of the list to act on," he said. "It's very important."
Any program or ordinance change would require the approval of the Bay City Commission.

Smart meter history and process
The Bay City commission
approved the upgrade to the smart meter system in October 2012
. The move means fewer visits from meter readers and more details to consumers about their usage.
Using a radio transmitter, the meters sendinformation daily about homeowners' electrical and water consumption to small towers placed around the city, which bounce the data to city servers.
The system can alert city utility officials earlier than the existing system of irregularusage, such as a major leak underground that could cost residents big dollars.
"If someone is out of town and their pipes burst, we'll receive an alert that shows a spike in usage, allowing us to respond and turn off the water before it becomes a big problem," said Dion. "If that happened today, we'd rely on residents calling us saying that there's water coming out of the basement windows of their neighbor's house."
The $6.8 million upgrade was paid for using money from a 2008 bond sale and electric and water rates, said George Martini, the city's fiscal services director. The bonds are expected to be paid off by the end of next year.
The Bay City Commission
recently approved
a rate increase of $3 to the customer service charge and 11-cents on the usage unit of 100 cubic feet of water.
There are four city employees swapping out meters for businesses and industrial properties, but most residents will see a Utility Partners of America truck parked outside their home. UPA, based in Greenville, S.C.,was hired based on recommendation from Badger Meter, the Wisconsin-based company that manufactures the smart meters. Dion said city employees couldn't handle the sheer volume of replacing all water meters, prompting the city to hire a third-party.
Electric meter swaps started in February and are more than 80 percent complete. Water meter swaps, which started in April, are about 20 percent complete.
"We're a little behind, but still think we can finish up the work by the end of the year," said Dion.
Once electric meters are swapped, those workers will transition to water meters, said Dion.
Representatives from an out-of-state call center are calling residents to schedule one-hour appointment windows to install the new meter and radio transmitter. Houses with updated meters only require the installation of the handheld-sized transmitter, which takes about 20 minutes. Installation of a new meter can take up to an hour and requires turning water off in the household for about a half hour, said Dion.
"The biggest hold up is trying to get people at their houses when an installer can be there," Dion said. "We need an adult at the house in order to do the install."
Job concerns
Despite some of the benefits of smart meters, some residents are questioning why the city needs them.
"Do we really need them?" asked Bob Philip, who had his meter recently replaced. "That  and how many jobs are they eliminating? The city doesn't need more job loss."
According to Finn, the city will eliminate four of its five meter reader positions, beginning next fiscal year, which starts July 1, 2015.
All five meter readers are budgeted to stay on the payroll for the current fiscal year, which started July 1. Once the entire system is online, the positions would be phased out if an employee opted to leave during the current fiscal year, said Martini.
It costs about $85,500 per meter reader with salary and fringe benefits, said Martini. Meter readers, who check water and electric meters, earn between $17.35 to $18.98 per hour and receive medical benefits from the city.
The city will keep one meter reader on to deal with any glitches with the new smart meter system, said Finn. Savings from the four eliminated positions work out to about $342,000 for next fiscal year.
Martini said the city would work to find other positions in the water or electric departments for impacted employees.
Other concerns
It's not just broken water valves that are rubbing residents the wrong way during the transition to smart meters.
Ray Armstrong said his meter has made a loud clicking noise, but city officials have told him it would be replaced.
Others say they're concerned about possible health issues due to the transmitter that sends off usage data to the city's servers.
"I've had residents call me saying the transmitters are a real concern for them," said Commissioner Elizabeth Peters, 2
nd
Ward.
Kim Haken, manager of Columbus Laundromat, which recently had to pay a $15,000 water bill after the city installed an incorrect meter reader and an ongoing clerical error, said city officials told her a new meter could increase her water bill.
Kilburn said that could be the case, but the new meter could also work in favor of the customer.
"If their meter was running slow before, it would benefit the city," he said. "But if it was running fast, it would benefit the customer."
Bay City Commission President, Lori Dufresne.
Bay City Commission President Lori Dufresne, 4
th
Ward, said she has had a resident complain about the meter being too loud and others about the waiver process as part of installation.
"I guess it's one of those things that we need more discussion on in order to smooth it out and make it feel easier for the residents," she said.
Personally, Dufresne, who works in Midland, said it was difficult for her to schedule a time to coordinate with a scheduler to install the meter.
"It's a challenge to find a convenient time," she said.
Several residents interviewed acknowledged the professionalism of the installers from UPA.
"We had a younger kid come to the house and he was very open with me," Nierenberg said. "When I told him I wasn't going to sign the waiver because I didn't want to deal with a broken valve, he even agreed with me and told me that I should get a plumber to look at it first."
Finn said opting out of the smart meter program won't be encouraged, but it is possible. Residents who decide against the new technology, however, would have to pay hefty fees for a meter reader to come to their residence each month.
"When we show the cost of a monthly reading to a resident, it becomes obvious pretty quickly that it's not in their best fiscal interest," he said.
