Unplugchargers to save money?
Don't bother!
You might have heard that unpluggingidle appliances around your home saves a lot ofelectricity.
Butfor the most part that's just not true. Idle phonechargers andpower adapters likely account for way less than 1% ofresidential energy use. (Those who claim it's 5-10%are looking at ancient studies from long ago before newregulationskicked in, and even then those old 5-10% figures are stillsuspectanyway.)
This means mostpeople can't save much electricity by unplugging their wallchargers.
You're
much
better off addressing your
heating
,
cooling
,
lighting
,
laundry
,and
computer
first.
Have youdone all that? Good.
Now
you can work onsavingpiddling 0.5% or so of household electrical use that comes fromvampirepower. For the full scoop, read on...
Thereare three kinds of things that use vampire power:
Devices in standby.
When you grab your TV's remote control and press ON, the TVhas to begetting a little juice already so it can receive that ONsignal andrespond to it. It's "standing by" waiting for you toturn it onwiththe remote. That's where we got the term "standbypower".Other thingsthat use standby power because they're waiting to respond to abuttonpress are DVD players, stereos, and microwave ovens.
Plug-in adapters.
These
arethe big black blocks that convert AC to DC. Some of themdrawsome electric even when the device they'repowering is turned off (or in the case of chargers, even whenthephone or device is fully charged). If the adapter iswarm even when thedevice isoff, it's wasting a little electricity, but usually not much.
Other devices that run off DC internally.
Insome devices the AC-to-DC adapter is internal, to avoid havingthe big,bulky plug-in adapter. This is really just like #2 aboveexceptthat you can't see the adapter.
Most modern devices use no more than 1 watt in standby mode,
and many of them use less than 0.5 watts.
(
WP
)
Aone-watt device that runs continuously uses 8.8 kWh peryear.But the typical American household uses 11,040 kWh peryear. Sothe standby power for one device represents a mere 0.08% of thehousehold's energy use. If the household has
twelve
ofthese devices, that still accounts for less than 1% of theentirehouseholduse. So now you'll see why chasing vampire power isusually awaste of time, unless you've already tackled your heating,cooling,laundry, lighting, and computer first.
Forwall chargers it's often even less.
Modernchargers go down to zero (or pretty close to it) when nothing'spluggedinto them. Even a charger using one watt when idle andplugged inconstantly would use only about $1 per year at averageelectricityrates.
But what about older devices and adapters?
Thosedo use a bit more energy when idle, but the effect isn't thatgreatunless you have a lot of them. If a modern device wasting1 wattwhen idle costs about $1 a year to leave plugged in constantly,then anolder device wasting 10 watts when idle costs only about $10 ayear.Not the low-hanging fruit.
As a test, I plugged in
nine
wall chargers/adaptersinto a power strip and measured the consumption with a meter.
Asyou can see from the picture at right, the meter read "0"  allninetogether didn't even use a single watt. I had to plug in a10thadapter to get the screen to change from 0 to 1 watt.
Oh, but maybe you've heard that the real penalty is leavingyour phone connected to a charger after it's already finishedcharging?
Hardly. I charged three phones and when they were finishedcharging, all three
together
used a mere 1 watt.(Duringcharging, all three together used 8 watts. See pictures atright.) Two of those phones were 2004 models, by the way,hardlythe latest and greatest.
How do you know whether your particular devices are drawingvampire power or not?
Measureit
!
Now,there
are
some things that it pays tounplug, but they're not phone chargers.
You'll save byunplugging (or putting on a switch):
Cable TV boxes & DVRs.
If they're not an EnergyStar models
and
made in 2013 or later, a cable TV box+ DVR combolikely sucking around 50 watts of power, 24/7.
(NRDC,
PDF
)
That'sabout as much as an Energy Star
refrigerator
, andclocksin at around $72/year of electricity if the rate is16/kWh. Of course, withmany of these models if you unplug them you'll have toreprogram themwhen you reconnect them, but dude, why are you watching cableTVanyway? It's 2013! Mr. Electricity won't allowthesedevices in hishome. And in fact, ditching cable in favor of Internetstreamingsaves the exorbitant cost of the cable service itself, whichdwarfs thecost of the electricity to run it.
Anything with a light that's always on
(unless it'san LED light, which is okay).
Water pumps.
If you have a water pump it'sprobably for a reason, but at least put it on a timer so itdoesn't run24/7.
How to combat vampire power
Address the low-hanging fruit first.
You're

Have youdone all that? Good.
Now
you can work onsavingpiddling 0.5% or so of household electrical use that comesfrom vampirepower.
Look for the Energy Star label when buying devices.
EnergyStar-approved products use little to no energy when idle.
Test the devices you already own
to see if they're using too much standby power.
If they're not using much, then there's not much point indoing thesteps below to combat standby power. Ten devices using 1watt ofstandby cost only about $1/mo. to run, using a sample rate of15/kWh.
Unplug devices and adapters when you're not using them.
Thismethod is free but inconvenient. If you want convenience youcanhave it for a few bucks, as the next few items show...
For one or two items, get a flip switch.
The onepictured at right is one of my favorites.
Itcost me all of $1.99.
For a two or more devices that will be on or off at thesame time, use a simple power bar with a switch.
The onepicturedat left was four bucks at Home Depot. Oh, so easy.
Forseveral devices that you want to switchseparately,get a power strip with individual switches.
Whilethese areubiquitous in other countries like Japan, they're hard to findin theU.S. But never fear,
Ifound one for you
, similar to the one pictured atright, for$20. If youprefer something more industrial or rack-mountable, there'sthe $27
Mr.DJ rack-mount AC switch bank.
.
For computer, TV, or stereo systems, you might like a
smartstrip
.
It's a special power stripthatautomatically cuts power to all all your accessory deviceswhen youturn off the main one. (e.g., Turn off the computer, anditautomatically cuts power to the printer and scanner.Turn off thestereo, and it automatically cuts power to the CD player, tapeplayer,etc.) Me, I prefer a switchbank like I mentioned above,becausethen I can keep myscanner and printer off while the computer is on, turning themon onlywhen I actually need to use them.
A U.K. product called
Bye
ByeStandby
lets you turn power to an outlet on and(completely)off using a remote control.
(The U.S. version has beendiscontinued.) This is handy if you have only a coupleof items to manage, and if the plug isn't in a convenientplace for aswitch.
More energy to run the clock than thedevice?
[The following was written back in the 90s when standbypower was higher than it is today, but I'm keeping it forhistoricalpurposes.]
When we talk about the "energy to run the clock" in amicrowave or VCR we're not really being fair, because thestandby powerdoes more than just run the clock.
It keeps a microwaveready torespond to any button you press, and keeps a VCR ready torespond tothe ON button on the remote control (or your instructions toautomatically come on at a certain time to record a program).But we'rebeing unfair today, so we'll talk about the power to run theclock, asthough that were the only thing going on when the device is off.
Okay, so my old VCR used 5 watts when it's "off", 12 wattswhenit's "on", and 18 watts when it's actually playing a tape.
Let's
sayI played tapes for an hour a day, and otherwise it was off.
ON:
1 hour
x
18 watts = 18 watt-hours
OFF:
23 hours
x
5 watts = 115 watt-hours
Yes, the clock uses more energy than the device itself. Waymore.
Is the same true of the microwave? It depends on how much youuse it, and how powerful your microwave is.
ON:
10 minutes
x
1000 watts = 167 watt-hours
OFF:
23 hours, 50 minutes
x
7 watts = 167watt-hours
So in this case the clock uses more energy than the oven ifyou use the oven for less than 7 minutes a day.
(Thisis anexample
because your own microwave likely uses a differentamountof energy when it's on and when it's in standby. The numbersabovearen't true for all microwaves.)
When energy-efficient appliancesaren't
My old Apple Personal Laserwriter 300 was toutedas being a modern energy-efficient appliance.
It didn'teven havean power switch! Apple designed it to automatically go intolow-powermode when it wasn't being used, consuming only five watts ofpower.
If you were the kind of person who never turned off yourprinter, then this would definitely save a lot of energy --most of thetime you'd be using only five watts instead of severalhundred.
Butif you're the kind of person who shuts things off when you'redone withthem, then all of a sudden this energy miser is really anenergywaster. It sucks five watts of power 24/7, whether you'reusing it ornot.
I solved this problem by putting it on a switchable powerstrip.
