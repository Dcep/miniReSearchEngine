What's the difference between a transformer and a solid state converter? The important difference is how the device converts voltage.
The household electricity our North American appliances use is delivered at 120VAC (volts alternating current)  60 Hz (60 cycles/second).  When the electric current flows it rises from 0 volts to 120 volts back to 0 volts and then it falls to negative 120 volts and rises back to 0 volts. This rise and fall completes one cycle (1 Hz) and is called a "sine wave." To convert 240VAC to 120VAC, for example, a
transformer
reduces the height of the 240 volt sine wave in half, creating a 120 volt sine wave that can be safely used by all types of 120VAC appliances, a
solid state converter,
however, chops the sine wave at its positive and negative 240 volt peak, reducing the power in half but creating a chopped waveform that can ONLY be used by NON-ELECTRONIC heating appliances.
Cycles: 50 Hz vs. 60 Hz
North American 120 volt electricity is generated at 60 Hz Alternating Current (AC). Most foreign 220240 volt electricity is generated at 50 Hz Alternating Current (AC). This difference in cycles may cause the motor in your 60 Hz North American appliance to operate slightly slower when used on 50 Hz foreign electricity.
As a rule of thumb, the appliances that are most affected by cycle differences are those with motors such as turntables, clocks, kitchen appliances, medical equipment and power tools. They will run faster or slower than they should depending upon the cycle difference and may be damaged in the long run as a result. As with any rule of thumb, however, there are many exceptions. The only way to be sure is to consult the appliance's technical documentation or contact the manufacturer.
Most modern electronic equipment, including battery chargers, computers, printers, stereos, MP3 and CD players, VCR/DVD players, etc., will not be affected by the difference in cycles.
IMPORTANT NOTE: Transformers and solid state converters do not convert cycles.
Polarized Plugs
In North America many ungrounded appliances are required to have plugs with one blade wider than the other. This type of plug is called a polarized plug. All Voltage Valet converters, adaptor plugs and heavy duty transformers will accept polarized plugs.
IMPORTANT NOTE: You may find some countries (parts of Central America, Japan, Mexico, etc.) that use the North American-style plug without polarized outlets. The Voltage Valet A adaptor plug will allow your polarized appliance to operate in those locations.
