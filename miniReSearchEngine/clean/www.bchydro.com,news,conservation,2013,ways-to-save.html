Use MyHydro to track your electricity use, then start cutting energy waste
There are many ways to help keep your electricity bills lower, especially in winter, when we generally see an increase in our electricity use.

Minimize energy waste, and your bills will be lower
You don't have to change your daily activities, but a few changes in the way you use electricity  and in the efficiency of your home  can make a huge difference.
Switch to ENERGY STAR CFL and LED bulbs
: CFLs use about 75 per cent less energy and can last up to 10 times longer than standard incandescent bulbs. LEDs also use about 75 per cent less energy and can last 20 years.
Learn about lighting costs in our
lighting comparison chart
.
See tips on how to draft proof, insulate your home and manage your thermostat
: Draftproofing your home can reduce your heat loss by 10 per cent, and it's relatively easy and inexpensive to do.
Know how to use space and baseboard heaters more efficiently
: only heat the rooms that you are using and remember to keep them free from obstructions to minimize fire risk.
Run your laundry load on cold
. On average, three loads of laundry washed in cold water will save you $54 a year when compared to washing in hot water*.
If you can shorten your showers by two minutes, you could save an average of $30 a year.*
Remember to turn off the lights when you leave a room.
Converting cold to cozy: put on a sweater or use a blanket instead of turning up the heat.
Buy
ENERGY STAR electronics
when replacing or upgrading. The most efficient ENERGY STAR television is 30 per cent more efficient than a standard television.
* If electric hot water heating is used.
Other programs to help you improve the efficiency of your home
The LiveSmart BC: Energy Efficiency Program provides homeowners with incentives for home energy efficiency upgrades. Incentives are being offered on air sealing, ventilation, insulation and much more.
