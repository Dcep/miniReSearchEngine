Did your estimated BGE bill seem too high?
Victoria Worden of Bel Air called to say she thought her August BGE bill was too high. Late last month BGE meter readers were helping restore power, with the result that BGE couldn't read about 170,000 meters -- including Worden's. Instead BGE sent out estimated bills. In 2010 Worden's August bill was in the $50 range, she says. This year, after BGE estimated it, the August bill was way higher -- $75.50, she says. And the average temperature for this August was a degree cooler than last year, according to BGE.
"$75 is way out of line," Worden says. She's not even sure she ran the AC last month, and she expected the bill to be much lower. Certainly lower than the bill from this July, which was really really hot. Especially since, after Hurricane Irene, she says she didn't have any electricity during part of August for almost 40 hours! But her bills were about the same for both July and August.
UPDATE, 11 a.m.: BGE put out a press release on this this morning, saying: "Baltimore Gas and Electric Company (BGE) today announced that as a result of Hurricane Irene, meter readers were assigned to storm duty and did not read any gas or electric meters from Aug. 30  Sept. 1. On August 29 and Sept. 2, some, but not all meters were read." BGE is saying 150,000 households were "affected," but the total number of homes with unread meters was 170,000, including  those on budget billing. BGE's full press release is below the fold.
If your bill seems too high for August and it's a hassle, do what Worden did and call BGE at 410-685-0123. She says they agreed to bill her zero for August and then put everything on the September bill once they read the meter. (If your estimated bill proves to be too high, BGE is supposed to credit the overbilled amount the next time the meter is read.)
I had a similar experience. My July 2011 bill was $277, and I figured August would be way lower. But it wasn't. BGE estimated that I owe $252 for last month. My average daily kilowatt use in August, according to BGE's estimate, was 25 percent more than it was in August 2010 -- even though, as mentioned, this year's August was cooler than last year's. (I didn't lose power after the hurricane, however.)
I asked BGE for a response to all customers who may believe they were overbilled. (BGE doesn't give me any special treatment, and I didn't ask them to change my bill.) BGE has software that estimates bills when meter readers can't get out, says Jeannette Mills, the utility's senior vice president for customer relations. The estimate is based on actual, metered usage of similar customers, BGE says. Sometimes it overestimates. Sometimes it underestimates, Mills said.
But it doesn't make allowances for when your power goes out. So there are probably other folks out there like Worden, with overestimated bills.
Mills denies that this gives a big boost to BGE's cash flow. "There is no windfall," she said. "There is no significant positive cash flow increase." BGE spokesman Rob Gould says that eliminating estimated bills will be one of the benefits of smart meters, due to be installed starting next year. They'll beam your kilowatt use straight to headquarters every day.
If you're on budget billing, where BGE smooths out seasonal variations to make your invoice more or less the same every month, your bill probably wasn't significantly altered by an unread meter last month, BGE says.

Baltimore Gas and Electric Company Customers May Receive Estimated Bills Due to Hurricane Irene
Meter readers assigned to storm duty for several days during and following hurricane
Approximately 150,000 customers will receive estimated bills due to hurricane
BALTIMORE, Sept. 14, 2011  Baltimore Gas and Electric Company (BGE) today announced that as a result of Hurricane Irene, meter readers were assigned to storm duty and did not read any gas or electric meters from Aug. 30  Sept. 1. On August 29 and Sept. 2, some, but not all meters were read. Customers whose meters were not read will receive estimated bills. When an actual reading is taken prior to the mailing of next months bill, usage will self-correct to ensure customers are only billed for the energy they actually used during those months.
Hurricane Irene was one of the biggest storms in BGEs 200-year history and it forced us to suspend normal business operations for several days in order to focus our attention on restoring electric service to our customers as safely and as quickly as possible, said Jeannette M. Mills, senior vice president and chief customer officer for BGE.  During large-scale storm restoration events such as Hurricane Irene, meter readers  like the majority of BGEs 3,000 employees  have storm assignments that are different from their normal day-to-day jobs.   BGEs meter readers were dispatched to address public safety concerns during and in the hours and immediate days following Hurricane Irene.  Many of them responded to reports of downed wires and sat in vehicles near downed wires to ensure the safety of others until a crew could respond and de-energize the wires or restore service. In this capacity, meter readers played a crucial role in our efforts to keep our customers and employees safe during this massive restoration effort.
To inform the approximately 150,000 customers affected by the estimated meter readings caused by Hurricane Irene, BGE employed the use of its automated telephone dialing system and attempted to contact all of these customers. Based on reports generated following these calls, BGE believes it successfully reached approximately 86 percent of these customers.
To further assist customers with monthly bills, BGE offers enrollment into its Budget Billing program which spreads payments out over a 12 month period so customers arent as affected by seasonal increases in usage. Additionally, customers are encouraged to contact BGE early if they are having trouble paying their bill to discuss alternative payment options.
BGE, www.bge.com, headquartered in Baltimore, is Marylands largest gas and electric utility, delivering power to more than 1.2 million electric customers and more than 640,000 natural gas customers in Central Maryland. The companys approximately 3,000 employees are committed to the safe and reliable delivery of gas and electricity, as well as enhanced energy management, conservation, environmental stewardship and community assistance.   BGE is a subsidiary of Constellation Energy, www.constellation.com, a FORTUNE 500 company also headquartered in Baltimore, with subsidiaries that generate, sell and provide other energy-related services to customers throughout North America.

Many homeowners who were without electricity for a week have higher bills this month than in July or August of last year. If this BGE/Constellation's way of making up for the cost of storm repairs?  They always have an angle. What is the definition of public utility?

I suggest we pay them what we estimate their service to be worth.
My power went out shortly after midnight on Thursday.  They began fixing it around 6:00 that evening.  Well after the 11:00 AM estimate to have it restored.

Maybe BGE can take the overcharges and invest  them in upgrading their crumbling infrastructure... not likely .   Perhaps the PSC  should fine BGE for each outage with part of it going to the people to help those chronically out purchase a generator.

From what I have read, the SMART METERS will CHARGE YOU MORE MONEY for the kilowatts you use during Peak Hours.  How it works ... when you get your whopping bills, you reduce the amount of electricity you use during peak hours.  This unfairly impacts vulnerable populations.  I know my eighty year old parents and some citizens with health and money concerns will turn of their electricity/AC/Heat  to save money. Stop the Smart Meters!

Yea, my bill was $200 for July.  August when it was much cooler and we didn't have power our bill was $250.  A $50 dollar increase?  They estimated our usage at 48 Kwh per day even though our usage in June/July was 29 and 36 respectively.  They better reimburse us at the charged rate for the electricity.

This is only the tip of the iceberg.
My parents typical monthly bill during the winter is usually at maximum $150 per month. However, when they couldn't get a reading from the second meter which they installed. They started their so called estimated billing.
For roughly 3.5 - 4 months. They were sent a bill for $2000. Even when I tried to reason with them about the average per month usage of $150 during the winter months for the past year. They refused to listen to logic. They said that their people couldn't read the meters so estimated billing was used.
It took close to a dozen phonecalls, 3 weeks, and having people come out in order to straighten out the issue. The second meter wasn't even on and turns out it never even had electricty pass through it.
We didn't even get an apology. The government needs to investigate this and see how rampant their billing abuse is.

My August estimated bill was also very similar to my July bill and higher than last year. The estimate should be your last year usage plus or minus a percentage based on the average temperture difference. PSC should audit BGE's cash flow for August. Of course with customers not having power they should have much less cash than LY.

BGE ALWAYS over charges for estimated bills.  They may make up the difference the following month, but for that one month they have accumulated a huge amount of money in overcharges that they either invest or make interest on.  Then they refund back only the principle.  A quick way to make customers basically give BGE a free interest free loan where they get to keep the interest.  Pretty slick!

Is an extra $25 really going to break Ms. Worden's bank?  If it truly is a hardship, she should think of it as a forced savings plan.  It's not like BGE is just taking the money.  Her bill next month will be much smaller and easier to pay.
Is it the interest she's worried about?  I'll be generous and use 1% APR (found only at internet banks these days) compounded monthly for one month.  That comes to about 2 cents.
There are bigger problems in the world, move along people.

@Cats McGee - I was thinking the same thing! I'd be the happiest camper in town if I received a bill that was $75 instead of the $350 I was charged for August.
The only thing worse than summer BGE bills are the $500+ bills I get in the winter.

My bill was $40 less than last summer for August. I admit I've been more careful about my power usage, but I never turned my a/c off for the whole month, unlike June and July when I was away or the temp let me let in fresh air.
BGE as all private utilities exist to make a profit. They will cut corners, use deceptive but not illegal practices, whatever it takes to give their stockholders and executives more in their pockets. Whatever geniuses decided that power generation should be private not government were wrong, because the mantra for private industry isn't serving the public, but making profits.

WOW!  What a bunch of whiners!  First, let me state that I am not an employee of BGE nor is anyone in my family.
We are so fortunate to live in an area where we have reliable and dependable and relatively inexpensive utilities.  I wonder how many of the people complaining here pay as much or more for cable tv and internet services as they do for the utilities that allow them to utilize the cable and internet.
Does anyone really think that BGE intentionally dragged their feet when it came to restoring power after Irene moved through the area because there was also a lot of whining about that.  BGE makes nothing off of their electric consumer if the consumer isn't using any electricity so they were redeploying meter readers to help expedite the reconnection of customers to their electricty.
Stop complaining and be grateful that we have access to reliable utilities unlike much of the world that lives in complete darkness when the sun goes down because they have nothing except maybe some candles or lanterns to light the night, if they're lucky.

Most folks billing cycles mean they have yet to see a bill that included the hurricane time period.
But upon closer inspection I see that our electricity DELIVERY rate in the last 6 months is up an average of 25% over  last year. In july it was 32% higher.
The average household is on track to pay $80 more this year than last to have BGE DELIVER their electricity.
A 24% bump for worse service.....hmm... me thinks the PSC is not doing its job.

I dare them to try to do this to me.  I still don't have power from Hurricane Irene because I had to get electrical work done.  Between the red tape I had to cut through between them and the city of Baltimore it has become a pain just to get my power back on.

Evesham is a Constellation Stock holder. And Evesham, people are not complaining that BGE delayed repairs - but that their bills should be less (or at least not higher) due to the lack of electricity for 1 week.
Jimbo - when you are on a fixed income - $25 more per month is a lot.
I was talking to a woman last week. Her house straddles PA/MD. The neighbors in PA had their power within 24 hours with Pepco. The MD folks waited a week for BGE repairs.

BEGINNING THIS SPRING OF 2012, BG&E PLANS TO INSTALL SMART METERS THAT WILL TRANSMIT 24/7, INTERMITTENT  PULSED RADIATION INTO EVERY HOME, SCHOOL, OFFICE AND HOSPITAL.
*  SMART METER RADIATION IS A CATEGORY 2B CARCINOGEN ACCORDING TO THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION.
*  SMART METER NETWORKS BLANKET ENTIRE NEIGHBORHOODS WITH PULSED MICROWAVE RADIATION AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WITH SMART METERS REPORT VARIOUS SYMPTOMS INCLUDING HEADACHES, HEART PALPITATIONS, NAUSEA, DIZZINESS, RINGING IN EARS, AND DIFFICULTY BREATHING.
*  WE ARE AT RISK FOR CANCER, NEUROLOGICAL DISEASE,  REPRODUCTIVE AND DEVELOPMENTAL IMPAIRMENTS.
* SMART METERS HAVE BEEN LINKED TO STRUCTURAL FIRES.
* IN PLACES WITH SMART METERS IT HAS BEEN PROVEN THAT CONSUMERS SAVE NO MONEY.
* SMART METERS VIOLATE PRIVACY BY TRACKING DETAILS OF ENERGY USAGE SUCH AS WHICH APPLIANCES ARE IN USE AND WHEN, WHETHER A HOME IS VACANT, ETC.
* COMPANIES ARE ALREADY HARVESTING AND MARKETING THIS TYPE OF DATA.
WHAT TO DO FOR NOW IF YOU DON'T WANT A SMART METER ON YOUR HOME:
1.  NOTIFY BOTH BG&E AND THE PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION  THAT YOU DO NOT WANT A SMART METER AFFIXED TO YOUR HOME.  SAMPLE LETTERS CAN BE DOWNLOADED FROM WWW.MarylandResidentsAgainstSmartMeters.org
2. JOIN MARYLAND RESIDENTS AGAINST SMART METERS  TO WORK FOR A MORATORIUM OR OPT-OUT AS PEOPLE ARE DOING IN OTHER STATES.

SMART METER PRIVACY VIOLATIONS.
1. Must-See 4-minute youtube video on Smart meters:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=8JNFr_j6kdI
SMART METER HEALTH PROBLEMS AND CANCER.
2. The WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION on May 31 2011 placed the Non-ionizing radiation coming from Wireless smart meters (and some other wireless devices) on the Class 2-B Carcinogen List.
http://www.iarc.fr/en/media-centre/pr/2011/pdfs/pr208_E.pdf
3. The NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF HEALTH months ago (Feb 2011) found biological changes in the brain after only minutes of exposure to non-ionizing radiation.
http://jama.ama-assn.org/content/305/8/808.abstract
4. LABORATORY SCIENTISTS have observed(1) Human Cell Damage(2) DNA Chain Breaks(3) Breaches in the Blood-Brain Barrier from levels of non-ionizing radiation lower than emitted by WIRELESS Smart meters.

5. INSURANCE COMPANIES Hired Independent Laboratory Scientists and these scientists also observed Cell Damage and DNA Chain Breaks and now the Insurance Companies will NOT Insure Liability damage from Wireless Smart meters and other wireless devices. TV Video (3 minutes)
http://eon3emfblog.net/?p=382
So shouldnt installation of Wireless smart meters on people's homes Stop?
Cell Phone use and other devices are Voluntary and can be shut off at the users discretion, but Smart meters are emitting radiation 24/7 and can not be shut off.

9. RADIATION MEASURED FROM SMART METER MOUNTED ON A HOME (once active in the utility system) SHOWS RADIATION TRANSMISSION PULSES APPROXIMATELY ONCE EVERY FOUR SECONDS 24 HOURS PER DAY traveling through the bodies and brains of the inhabitants of that home.  Youtube Video (6 minutes, 1st minute is sufficient)
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRejDxBE6OE
NOTE: many of the tests on non-ionizing radiation (the type of radiation emitted by smart meters) have been done using instruments other than smart meters because smart meters have only been in peoples homes for a very short time.
But as a Wireless smart meter emits 100 times more radiation than a cell phone, it is not difficult to project.  If a machine gun (smart meter) fires 100 bullets in the same time that a pistol (cell phone) fires one bullet, it is not difficult to project the harm that the machine gun can inflict, even if the tests were done with the pistol.

Jay mentions 1 advantage of smart meters.  Another is that during a power outage, the utility know exactly who is without power.  Thursday after the storm, BGE called us to see if we had power (we didn't). Once the power was back on, they called us again to see if power was restored.  I had called in, several times, to report power out, I was surprised they didn't have a better way to determine if we had power or not.

The Smart Grid and all its benefits can be achieved through other, safer technologies such as has been done in Italy.
It is not necessary to harm health, invade privacy, and raise rates in order to have a Smart Grid.

I have to question the "world health organization" just like I question the "IMF" or the "United Nations".
My cell phone is probably more likely to cause me harm than a smart meter.  The water I drink from Baltimore city is probably laced with high amounts of lead and or mercury.  The air I breath is filled with toxins from the car you drive.  The chicken and milk I drink is filled with hormones.
So what do i do?  Complain about smart grid?  Hell, it's probably safer than everything else I just talked about.  I'll take smart grid over Baltimore City water purposely lased with fluoride to help 'protect me' any day, I'll take smart grid over milk saturated with chemicals that are to help 'protect' me from illness.
The more important question.  Will smart grid affect radio frequencies like Broad Band over Power lines did a few years back making it so emergency responders and ham radio operators received interference when communicating.  That's my real question!

Could Robert Williams who wrote on Sept. 15th,2011, putting together an invaluable resource sheet on Smart Meters, please contact Maryland Residents Against Smart Meters at info@MarylandResidentsAgainstSmartMeters.org.
Smart Meter radiation needs to be compared to cell tower radiation, not cell phone radiation, according to leading experts.  Each building with a Smart Meter becomes part of an interconnected microwave transmission system (mesh network), thus blanketing entire neighborhoods with pulsed microwave radiation.
So it's important to speak with your neighbors.
You can turn off your cell phone.  You can't turn off your Smart Meter. It operates 24/7.
According to Sage Associates, having a Smart Meter is like living within 500 feet of a major cell tower.
According to UC Nuclear experts, the exposure is at least 100x the exposure from a cell phone.

Thanks to energy deregulation people have the ability to choose who they want as their energy supplier and actually save money on their BGE bill every month as well as make money every month!!!  Energy is a life-essential service people use and need every day. You can talk to anybody who was without power during the hurricane and they can tell you how miserable they were without it.  Regardless of where you live, everyone will continue to pay an energy bill every month. If you got to pay it, why not save some money!!! Think about all the people you know who pay an energy bill every month.  Now you have the ability to help them save some money every month and you can also make some money every month.
I live in the Laurel area and my power was out for almost a week, but even in the mist of the inconvenience of having no power my husband and I both got an energy income check 2 days after the hurricane.

I was shocked to see that BGE guestimated 100% over the normal usage for August billing - this is certainly a dirty scheme they decided to run to cover repair costs. How do I tell if I got credit on my Sept bill for overcharging? About smart meters... transmitting that powerful signal 24/7 is not gonna be cheap. I guess homeowners will be paying to their own death-ray emmissions? I see lawsuits popping up like mushrooms for BGEvil.
