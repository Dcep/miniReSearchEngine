All You Need to Know About Solar Power.
Trying to work out what exactly you need for a solar power system can be daunting. People may end up spending a small fortune and still not have the power they feel they need. Im very grateful to a man called Klaus who visited my earthbag home this winter. In less than half-an hour he plied me with enough information to enable me to design a solar system tailor-made to my needs.
You dont need to invest vast amounts of cash if you dont have it. But you do need some stats. The trouble is information on small off-grid solar systems is curiously hard to find, or at the very least tricky to unravel.
Here I've cobbled together an idiot's guide to small, cheap solar systems in an attempt to shed some light on the strangely nebular science of solar power.
Basic Solar Power Equipment.
Batteries, an inverter and a regulator.
There are four main components to your solar power system
1.Solar panels.
These draw in the
suns energy for you. The more efficient your panel, the more energy they
absorb.
The two main types of solar panel are Monocrystalline (black) or Polycrystalline (blue/dark blue). There is still much confabulation about which is better and you can follow that debate
here
if you like. The truth is the manufacturer is more important than mono or poly. And the consensus seems to be that it's the Germans (no surprise there) that are pushing out the most efficient panels.
2. Batteries.
These store the
power collected by the panels. The more you store, the more you can use when
theres no sun.
Again you are faced with a choice. Dry or wet batteries? You can use either in your solar system though wet are usually more readily available. Read about the pros and cons of each
here
if you are so disposed.
3. Regulator (controller).
This is
the brain of your system. If your batteries over-charge or over-drain, their
longevity is severely reduced. The regulator controls how much your batteries
can charge. When they reach their optimum limit (preferably about 14.5 V) the
regulator stops power coming in from the panels.
4.
Inverter.
Batteries pump out
power at 12V. The inverter converts the 12V into a voltage suitable for your house-hold
appliances (usually 220V or thereabouts).
Watt? You don't know a volt from an amp?
So you've got your basic solar power equipment. All well and good. However, trouble brews when you want to use appliances that need more power than your system can handle. This is where you a cursory amount of electrical knowledge goes a long way.
Volts
= Electricitys
equivalent to water pressure. The higher the voltage the more electrical
current flows.
Amps (current
) =
Electrical flow rate
Watts
= How
electrical power is measured.
Voltage multiplied by amps = Watts.
I have a small inexpensive system (cost a little over 1000 sterling) with two 160 watt solar panels, two 200 watt batteries, a600 watt inverter and a 20 amp regulator. But what does that MEAN?
1. I cant use any appliance, or
group of appliances that are over 600 watts. The inverter cant handle it (actually better to stay below about 300 watts).
2.
I cant use any appliance, or
group of appliances that burn more than 20 amps. The regulator cant handle it.
3.There is a finite amount of
power stored in the batteries. For the health of the batteries the system functions
between 10.5 and 14.5 amps. That means I have 4.5 amps to play with when the
panels arent sucking in light. So . . .At night time or after prolonged periods of
rain the batteries will begin to run down.
Basically, I need appliances of less than 50 watts. As a general rule, small motors and battery chargers get the green light. However, anything that heats is a power-eater. I've already given away my toaster.
What I can use.
Laptop computer.
Normal computer.
Printer,
CD player.
DVD player.
Speakers with subwoofer.
Mobile phone charger.
Power drill battery charger.
Power sander battery charger.
Power jig-saw battery charger.
LED lights
Normal lights
Standing lamps
Lava/Tesla lamps, should I so desire...
Epilady (This is mighty fine news).
Electric razor.
Small mini-bar type refrigerator.
Electric cool box (camping type)
Television.
At just 7 Watts your epilady is still in business.
What I can't use.
Air conditioner.
Kettle.
Toaster.
Electric hob.
Washing machine.
Large refrigerator.
Freezer.
Iron (Someone remind me what the point of this appliance is).
Curling tongs and hair straighteners (sorry Jeanette).
Blender.
Cappuccino machine.
Waffle maker.
Vacuum cleaner.
A small solar system may require sacrifices. Wavy hair and waffle-less breakfasts are just two of the downsides.
Is a small system worth it?
In conclusion, for people off the grid with not much spare cash, the two-panel, two-battery option is a great solution to power issues. Later, if you really cant do without your cappuccino machine, either your system can be upgraded, or you can create a separate system for that appliance.
