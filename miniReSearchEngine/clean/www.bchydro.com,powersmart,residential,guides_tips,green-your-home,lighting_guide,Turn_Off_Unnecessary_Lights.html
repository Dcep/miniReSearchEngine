Turn Off Lights
Turn Off Unnecessary Lights
TURN IT OFF
Turning off lights that aren't being used is a simple and effective way to save energy. It does not require any equipment and the energy savings can be significant.
Affordability
Turning off lights is free. Breaking old lighting habits is the challenge.
Cost savings
The moment a light is turned off, it stops using energy, so your savings add up by the minute. If every household in B.C. turned off a 100-watt incandescent light for four hours each day, each bulb could save 3.3 cents a day. It would also save the province 227 GWh, which could power Whistler for 12 years.
Health & comfort
Many people find cutting electric light in favour of natural light to be calming. Natural light covers the full light spectrum, which gives it a comfortable
colour temperature
and tone that is difficult to mimic.
Turning off unnecessary lights also reduces light that may shine onto your neighbour's property and into bedroom windows, reducing privacy and hindering sleep.
Environmental considerations
Since there is no equipment required to turn lights off, there are no environmental impacts from product manufacture, shipping or disposal. Get everyone in your household into the habit. Turning off unnecessary lights also
reduces the light that may be cast up into the sky
, benefiting migrating birds, and preserving our view of the stars.
What you need to know
Turn off lights whenever a room is unoccupied, even if it's only for a few minutes.
Try putting reminders next to light switches until you get into the habit.
Taking it further
Ensure light switches are placed next to doorframes to make turning off an easy motion as you exit a room. Consider connecting an electrical outlet placed in a sitting area to your wall switch so that focused task lighting can be easily turned off at the door when you leave.
Install
timers or photocells
to control your
outdoor lights
. Photocells will automatically turn lights on at dusk and off at dawn.
Turn off lights wherever there is adequate natural light. Arrange your furniture to make the most of windows, skylights and other natural lighting. If you are building or renovating, think about
maximizing the sun's heat and light
benefits when you position windows and skylights.
Arrange the lighting in your home so you can vary lighting levels and focus light where you need it most. Using task lighting, such as desk lamps and spot lighting in kitchens, is more efficient than lighting a whole room to the brightness you need for one area. Check out our
Adjust Lighting Levels
tip for more ideas.
FAQ
Does it take more energy to turn a light back on than is saved by turning it off for a short period of time?
No. For most home lighting, there is no extra energy draw when a light is switched on. While fluorescent lamps do use a tiny bit more upon start-up, if the light is off for more than a few minutes, you'll save energy.
Will turning lights on and off wear out the light bulbs faster?
It is true that
Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFLs)
can be sensitive to rapid on/off cycling in situations where only brief illumination is required. If you have a light in a closet or somewhere you need to quickly put it on or off, for now its better to use an incandescent in that space. But ensure you turn it off! If you are leaving it on for a few minutes at a time, its to use a CFL.
