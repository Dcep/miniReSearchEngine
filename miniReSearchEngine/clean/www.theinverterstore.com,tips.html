What type of power inverter do I need to power my HP D110 Inkjet printer?
One of our clients asked us to supply them with a DC to AC power inverter to power an HP D110 inkjet printer in one of their police vehicles. We were able to do some testing on this unit in our building. We found that this printer requires an AIMS Power pure sine inverter.
We supplied them with the AIMS 300 watt pure sine power inverter with dual ac outlets, which will allow them to plug their laptop in at the same time. This AIMS power inverter comes with a cigarette lighter adaptor giving them quick and easy access to run their HP D110 inkjet printer.
Customers do have the flexibility of installing this pure sine power inverter elsewhere in the vehicle. This would most commonly be done by direct connecting to the vehicle battery. The printer will then be plugged into the
power inverter
and placed in the most convenient spot for use.
How do I run my sump pump during a power outage?
You can use a power inverter to power your sump pump during a power outage. Sump pumps vary in size. The most common that our customers call us to power are 1/3 horsepower sump pumps, and 1/2 horsepower sump pumps. The best option we have here at theinverterstore.com would be our inverter/charger with built in transfer switch.
From our experience, 1/3 hp sump pumps and below can be ran with our AIMS Power 1500 watt power inverter with charger and built-in transfer switch. For higher capacity pumps like a 1/2 hp sump pump you should use AIMS Power 3000 watt power inverter with charger and built-in transfer switch.
The sump pump is first connected to the power inverter. The inverter is connected to both your battery bank and city power. As an added benefit to this, the incoming AC power will charge and maintain the battery(s) for you. The sump pump is run off of AC power directly through the power inverter/charger. When AC power is lost the inverter will automatically transfer to the battery bank.
An automatic sump pump back up system, like the one offered by theinverterstore.com, gives the customer piece of mind. Back up sump pump systems ensure that the pump will have constant power supply whether you are home or away. As you already know hurricanes, tropical storms and other heavy rain can deliver a lot of water to your sump. Investing in an inverter/charger with transfer switch is better than repairing a basement from flood damage during a hurricane or heavy storm.
How do I keep my 1/3 horsepower sump pump running during a hurricane or tropical storm?
You can use a power inverter to make sure your sump pump keeps working during a power outage. We recommend the AIMS Power 1500 watt power inverter/charger with built in transfer switch. Along with the inverter, you will need a battery bank to power the sump pump when the AC power is out.
The size of your battery bank will depend on how much emergency backup power you want to provide your sump pump system. We recommend that you use deep cycle batteries, which you can find on our site. Generally, 1 or 2 AGM sealed lead acid 100 amp hour batteries would be the minimum battery bank you would want to install. Keep in mind that a couple of extra batteries could save your home from major damage during a storm, so do not be afraid to have more power than you think you need. You will be much more comfortable in a hurricane or storm knowing you have this extra power on standby.
The inverter will need to be connected to the battery bank using #4 AWG UL listed cables. Theinverterstore.com recommends always using an inline fuse kit within 12 inches of the battery bank on the positive terminal. A fuse kit prevents a battery fire caused by a ground fault. When the AC power goes out, this inverter/charger will automatically switch over to run off the batteries. Eliminating the need to wake up in the middle of the night and start your noisy generator.
Can I keep my 1/2 horsepower sump pump running during a tropical storm or hurricane?
You can use the AIMS 3000 watt inverter charger with built in transfer switch to power your sump pump during a power outage. Along with the inverter, you will need a battery bank to power the sump pump when the AC power is unavailable in an outage. The sump pump needs backup power to keep your basement dry during a hurricane.
The amount of emergency power you have available will depend on the size of your battery bank, as well as how often your sump pump cycles on and off. We recommend you use deep cycle marine batteries to build your battery bank. Generally, 1 or 2 AGM sealed lead acid 100 amp hour batteries would be the minimum you would want to use. In terms of backup power, you will never have too much power. In a big storm, like Hurricane Irene in 2011, people were without power for many days in some heavily populated areas. Having extra emergency backup power will prevent serious damage to your home during a hurricane or tropical storm.
The inverter will need to be connected to the battery bank using 1/0 AWG UL listed cables. Theinverterstore.com recommends always using a inline fuse kit within 12 inches of the battery bank on the positive terminal to prevent a battery fire caused by a ground fault. When the AC power goes out, this inverter/charger will automatically switch over to run off the batteries. Eliminating the need to wake up in the middle of the night and start your noisy generator.
DC to AC Inverter FAQ
Click below for answers to common questions:
1. What size of   				inverter do I need?
2. What is the   				difference between modified, pure sine wave inverters?
3. How do I hook   				up the inverter to my battery(s)?
4. What equipment can   				I use with an inverter?
5. How long can   				I run my equipment with battery and inverter?
1. What size?
An inverter needs to supply   					two needs - Peak or surge power, and the typical or usual   					power.
Surge
is the maximum power that the inverter can supply,  usually for only a short time (usually no longer than a second unless specified  in the inverters specifications). Some appliances, particularly those with  electric motors, need a much higher start up surge than they do when running.  Pumps, compressors, air conditioners are the most common example-another common  one is freezers and refrigerators (compressors). You want to select an inverter  with a continuous rating that will handle the surge rating of your appliance so  you dont prematurely burn out the inverter. Dont rely on the inverters surge  to start your equipment because inverters dont like to operate in their surge  mode unless the manufacturer claims to have a longer surge time than normal.
Typical
is what the inverter   						has to supply on a steady basis. This is the
continuous
rating. This is usually much lower than   						the surge. For example, this would be what a   						refrigerator pulls after the first few seconds it takes   						for the motor to start up, or what it takes to run the   						microwave - or what all loads combined will total up to.   						(see our note about appliance power and/or name tag   						ratings at the end of this section).
You can use   					the following formula to determine the size:
Volts * Amps = watts
or
Watts / Volts = amps
1250 Watt example:
1250 / 120 Vac = 10.41 amps ac   					(typical number found on equipment)
or
1250 / 12 Vdc = 104.1 amps dc   					(battery drain per hour)
Here is an example:
First, you need to determine what items you need to power during a power  failure and for how long. Here is a brief example (watt requirements vary):
Lights - About 200 watts
Fridge - About 1000 watts
Radio - About 50 watts
Heater - About 1000 watts
Total wattage needed is 2250 watts. The fridge and heater have a start up power  requirement so let's allow 2x the continuous wattage for start up requirements.  2250 * 2 = 4500 watts
Second, select an inverter. For this example, you will need a power inverter  capable of handling 4500 watts. The continuous power requirement is actually  2250 but when sizing an inverter you have to plan for the start up so the  inverter can handle it.
Third, you need to decide how long you want to run 2250 watts. Let's say you  would like to power these items for an 8 hour period. Well this can be tricky  because heaters and fridges run intermittently.  Let's assume all of the appliances will run 40% of the 8 hr period which is 3.2  hours of actual run time. We need to convert the ac watts to dc amp hours  because that's how batteries are rated.
To convert ac watts to dc amps per hour you divide the watts by the DC voltage  (usually 12v or 24volts). Let's use 12volts since it is the most common.
2250 watts / 12 vdc = 187.50 dc amps per hour
187.50 is now your power requirement per hour
You have now determined that 187.50 is your power requirement per hour and now  you need to multiply that by total hours of run time which is 3.2 in our  example.
187.50 dc amps per hour 3.2 hours = 600 dc amps
Because you are using an inverter, you want to calculate the loss for  converting the power which is usually around 5%.
(600 dc amps * 5%)+ 600 dc amps = 630 dc amps per hour (this is how much power  you need in an 8 hour period running your appliances 40% of the time)
Fourth, now that you know your total power requirement is 630 dc amps we can  select a battery source. Most typical deep cycle batteries are 6 volts or 12  volts. I will give you two examples using each voltage.
12 volt
battery example:
If you select a 12 volt battery rated at 100 dc amps you will need 6 or 7  batteries in parallel (I will explain parallel vs. series later).
630 dc amps / 100 dc amp battery = 6.3 batteries
6 volt battery example:
If you select a 6 volt battery rated at 200 dc amps you will need 6 batteries in series and parallel.
3.15 * 2 = 6.3 batteries
No, I didn't make a mistake. When you use 6 volt batteries, you have to connect  them in series to reach 12 volts.  Then you connect each series pair of 6 volts in parallel to create your 12 volt battery bank.
What is series and parallel you ask?
When you connect batteries is parallel you are increasing amps. When you  connect batteries in series you increase voltage. In the battery world, it is  better to limit your parallel strings. It is better for your power system. In  this example, I would recommend using 6 volt batteries because of the number of  batteries this example requires.
How do we charge these batteries? You will need a charger to charge the  batteries when you have access to city power. Most deep cycle batteries need a  "smart" charger so the charger doesn't damage the batteries. In this  example, you will need at least a 40 amp charger if not bigger. The bigger the  charger, the faster the charge. Make sure your charger is for 12 volt batteries  because the system we just identified is a 12 volt system.
You will also need cables. For this example, a 4 AWT (0000) cable is required  to handle 4500 watts of start up power. That is huge cable. You may also want  to consider an inline fuse. A 500 amp for this example is perfect. To figure  out the size of fuse you divide your ac watts (start up) by dc voltage.
4500 watts / 12 vdc = 375 amps
You would need a 375 amp fuse or bigger. I recommend a 500 amp just incase you  were to max out the 5000 watt inverter.
This is just a brief example. There are many different ways to set up your  system. You can use solar panels, wind etc.

2. Difference between modified, pure sine wave inverters?
There   							are 3 major types of inverters - pure sine wave (or "true" sine wave), modified   							sine wave (actually a modified square wave), and   							square wave.
Pure Sine Wave
A pure sine wave is what you get from your local   							utility company and from some pure sine generators (most generators are not pure sine).
major advantage of a pure sine wave inverter is   								that all of the equipment which is sold on the   								market is designed for a pure sine wave. This   								guarantees that the equipment will work to its   								full specifications.
Some appliances, such as motors and microwave   								ovens will only produce full output with  pure   								sine wave power.
A   								few appliances, such as bread makers, light   								dimmers, and some battery chargers require a   								pure sine wave to work at all.
audio equipment, satellite systems, and video   								equipment, will run properly using 								pure sine wave inverters.
these are the most expensive of the inverter   								designs and outperform all other types of   								inverters, regardless of use.
Analog Pure Sine Wave
The sine wave produced by an analog pure sine wave   							inverter, is very similar to that of the digital   							pure sine wave inverter. The key difference is   							that the analog switching causes noise or static on   							the ac wave.
generally most appliances, motors, microwaves,   								chargers, and power tools will produce full   								power and not cause any buzzing or negative   								effects.
these types of pure sine inverters are not   								recommended for medical equipment unless   								manufacturer approved.
use this inverter for electric shavers and   								emergency flashlights,   								garage door openers, laser printers and large   								strobes used in photography
Modified Sine Wave
(quasi-sine)
A modified sine wave inverter actually has a   							waveform more like a square wave, but with an extra   							step. A modified sine wave inverter will work fine   							with most equipment, although the efficiency or   							power of the equipment will be reduced with some.
Motors, such as refrigerator motor, pumps, fans   								etc will use more power from the inverter due to   								lower efficiency. Most motors will use about 20%   								more power. This is because a fair percentage of   								a modified sine wave is higher frequencies -   								that is, not 60 Hz - so the motors cannot use   								it.
Some fluorescent lights will not operate quite   								as bright, and some may buzz or make annoying   								humming noises.
Appliances with electronic timers and/or digital   								clocks will often not operate correctly. Many   								appliances get their timing from the peak of the   								line power - basically, the modified sine has a   								flat top rather than a peak - this may cause the   								occasional double trigger. Because the modified   								sine wave is noisier and rougher than a  pure sine wave, clocks and timers may run faster   								or not work at all.
Items such as bread makers and light dimmers may   								not work at all - in many cases appliances that   								use electronic temperature controls will not   								control. The most common is on such things as   								variable speed drills will only have two speeds   								- on and off.
most equipment will operate without any   								noticeable difference, and because the lower   								cost, makes this the most common inverter sold   								and generally the only type found at your local   								retailer.
Square Wave
Very few but the very cheapest inverters any   							more are square wave. A square wave inverter will   							run simple things like tools with universal motors   							with no problem - but not much else. These are   							seldom seen any more except in the very cheap or   							very old ones. Of course we don't sell these. Too   							cheap!

3. How do I hook up   					my inverter to my battery?
You will need cables. A few of our models   					include cables. If you need a longer cable, please see our

4. What equipment can I use with an   							inverter?
Anything! Ok...   							almost anything.
In general most   							equipment or devices that you use at home or a   							commercial job can be used with an inverter but   							check with your equipment manufacturer.
Audio Equipment
Some top-of-the-line audio gear is protected by SCRs   							or Triacs. These devices are installed to guard   							against power line spikes, surges, and trash (nasties   							which don't happen on inverter systems). However,   							they see the sharp corners on modified sine wave as   							trash and will sometimes commit electrical hara-kiri   							to prevent that nasty power from reaching the   							delicate innards. Some are even smart enough to   							refuse to eat any of that ill-shaped power, and will   							not power up. The only sure cure for this (other   							than more tolerant equipment) is a digital or pure   							sine wave inverter.
Computers
Computers run happily on modified sine wave but   							better on pure sines. The first thing the   							computer does with the incoming AC power is to run   							it through an internal power supply. We've had a few   							reports of the power supply being just a bit noisier   							on modified sine, but no real problems. Running your   							prize family-heirloom computer off an inverter will   							not be a problem. What can be a problem is large   							start-up power surges. If your computer is running   							off the same household inverter as the water pump,   							power tools, and microwave, you're going to have   							trouble. When a large motor, like a skill saw, is   							starting, it will momentarily pull the AC system   							voltage way down. This can cause computer crashes.   							The fix is a small, separate inverter that only runs   							your computer system. It can be connected to the   							same household battery pack, and have a dedicated   							outlet or two.
Ceiling Fans
Most variable-speed ceiling fans will buzz on   							modified sine wave current. They work fine, but the   							noise is annoying. Invest in a pure sine.
Radio Frequency Interference
All inverters broadcast radio static when operating.   							Most of this interference is on the AM radio band.   							Do not plug your radio into the inverter and expect   							to listen to the ball game; you'll have to use a   							battery powered radio and be some distance away from   							the inverter. This is occasionally a problem with TV   							interference when inexpensive TVs and smaller   							inexpensive inverters are used together. Distance   							helps. Put the TV (and the antenna) at least 15 feet   							from the inverter. Twisting the inverter input   							cables may also limit their broadcast power (strange   							as it sounds, it works).
Phantom Loads and Vampires
A phantom load isn't something that lurks in your   							basement with a half-mask, but it's close kin. Many   							modern appliances remain partially on when they   							appear to be turned off. That's a phantom load. Any   							appliance that can be powered up with a button on a   							remote control must remain partially on and   							listening to receive the "on" signal. Most TVs and   							audio gear these days are phantom loads. Anything   							with a clockVCRs, coffee makers, microwave ovens,   							or bedside radio-clocksuses a small amount of power   							all the time.
Medical Equipment
Customers   							frequently ask us about the use of inverters for   							medical equipment. Unless specifically noted in the   							regulatory approvals for the product, assume that no   							AIMS inverter has regulatory approval for use with   							medical devices or life support equipment. If you   							use a AIMS Power Inc. inverters with a medical   							device its at your own risk.
