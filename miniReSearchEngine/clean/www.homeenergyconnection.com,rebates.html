Solar Water Heating
Solar water heaters:
Solar hot water systems can be a  cost-effective way to generate hot water for your home or business. They can be  used in any climate, and the fuel they use, (the sun) is free. Solar water  heating systems include storage tanks and solar collectors. Most solar water  heaters require a well-insulated storage tank. Solar storage tanks have an  additional outlet and inlet connected to and from the collector. In two-tank  systems, the solar water heater preheats water before it enters the  conventional water heater. In one-tank systems, the back-up heater is combined  with the solar storage in one tank.
