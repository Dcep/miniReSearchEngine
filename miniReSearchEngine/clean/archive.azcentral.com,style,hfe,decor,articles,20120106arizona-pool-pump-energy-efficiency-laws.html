New laws take aim at inefficient pool pumps
by

Special for The Republic | azcentral.com
With the arrival of winter and chilly weather, your backyard pool is probably the last thing on your mind.
But if you're not aware of the new pool-pump regulations that went into effect the first day of 2012, you could find yourself in troubled waters.
The Arizona Legislature recently passed new energy-efficiency standards for residential pool pumps and portable electric spas.
Led by a similar law in California and other states, the pool-building industry for years has been trying to design and build pools that use less energy.
So how does this new law affect pool owners? While it doesn't mean you need to run out and change your in-ground pool and spa motor immediately, it does require any newly installed pumps of at least one horsepower or greater to meet the new standards.
Dual-speed, multiple-speed or variable-speed pumps will be the minimum efficiency for pool-pump installations moving forward, and inefficient single-speed pumps no longer will be allowed in new installations.

The culprit:
Single-speed pumps work fine for simply circulating pool water. However, they don't efficiently harness enough power to run your pool cleaner, waterfall or other electrical extras that need an occasional, bigger blast of energy.
If you're running a pump with only one speed, it's always on -- running full-blast even when your pool cleaner and waterfall aren't operating. There's no option to dial back to a lower level of energy while it's in use (for example: when all you need is to circulate the water, which is most of the time).
That's a huge waste of energy, and it's costing you about 90 percent more in electric bills than you should be paying.
The good news:
You may not know that your pool pump uses more electricity than any other appliance in your house except your air-conditioner. You also may not know that most pools are equipped with pumps that are too big and use way more energy than you need to keep the water sparkling clean. The new regulation will ultimately help homeowners save money over time.
Manufacturers claim variable-speed pumps can cut energy use by up to 90 percent compared with single-speed pumps. Craig O'Grady, who owns Desert Sun Pools in Phoenix, says his customers who already have made the switch report saving $300 or more a year on their electric bills.
"The variable-speed, in my opinion, is the way to go," says O'Grady. "They're quieter and have a lot of great attributes. Mostly, there's incredible savings for homeowners. After the first three years, you're going to save a considerable amount of money. Some of my customers are only paying $100 per year, and some as low as $55. That's an incredible savings."
The bad news.
Although the general public really is just learning about the new regulation, there's already quite a bit of criticism coming from the pool industry. First, the standards will require consumers to purchase pricey, energy-efficient upgrades for any pumps they replace. On average, the cost to make the switch can be about $1,200 to $1,400 for parts and installation.
"It's ultimately a good thing for the homeowner, though," O'Grady says. "You'll recoup the money you spend in three years. After that, you're going to be saving a lot of money."
Second, some licensed pool professionals, including O'Grady, are upset there isn't any enforcement planned or penalties in place for pool companies that try to skirt the law and install single-speed pumps. The lack of punishment for unlicensed pool companies that don't follow the law could give rise to unlicensed service technicians skirting the law and may draw customers away from rule-abiding pool professionals.
Another criticism is that pump upgrades often entail more than a straight swap. For example, if customers have old automation systems, they have to pay to upgrade their entire boards.
Rebates.
Both SRP and APS are offering rebates to customers who make the upgrade. Basically, both are offering a $200 rebate on all newly manufactured variable-speed pumps and $100 back on dual-speed models. If you go with the dual-speed model, you'll also need to purchase a timer or control board -- a second piece of equipment that's capable of switching motor speeds automatically. An additional $75 rebate is being offered -- one per household -- when you purchase one of these newly manufactured seasonal timers.
Call your utility provider or visit
aps.com
or
srpnet.com
for details about how to take advantage of rebates being offered where you live. Also, get together with your pool professional before making any purchases to ensure you're taking advantage of the rebate properly.
More ways to save.
1.
Sign up with your electric utility for a time-of-use rate plan. APS and SRP offer them. You'll pay a reduced rate for electricity if you run your pool pump and other appliances, such as your dishwasher or washing machine, during hours of the day when demand for electricity isn't at its peak.
Example: SRP will cut your "off-peak" rate from the standard 11 cents per kilowatt-hour (a measure of electricity use) to about 6.5 cents if you run your pool pump and other appliances from 8 p.m. to 1 p.m. during the summer. If you run the devices between 1 p.m. and 8 p.m., you'll pay more to use the same electricity.
SRP estimates time-of-use-plan customers save up to 7 percent on their electric bills.
2.
Run your pool pump less. It's not necessary to run it round-the-clock. Most manufacturers recommend running it between eight and 10 hours a day in the summer and about half that in the winter.
3.
Put a timer on the pump so it automatically shuts off after those hours, and set it to run only when you're paying off-peak rates.
4.
Switch to LEDs, which use up to 75 percent less energy than your traditional incandescent underwater lights. LEDs last for years and come in multiple colors.
5.
Keep your chemicals in balance. Doug Sydenham of Postorino Pool Service & Repair in Scottsdale says it costs about $125 to have a pool service come out and test the level of "total dissolved solids," such as calcium, in the water and determine whether you need to drain and refill your pool.
6.
Clean trap baskets, filters and pool walls and floor regularly. Clogged baskets and filters can prevent the water from flowing freely and will slow your filter. The harder the pump has to work to keep the pool clean, the more you'll pay to run it.
