Got a vacuum and the head stopped spinning. Called and got a new head sent out free of charge. Turns out, the second one stopped working too and after 30 seconds later, we have a whole new vacuum on the way. Honestly, this is the best customer service I have ever experienced.

I am amazed every time I use my Shark Navigator by the amount of dust and dirt it picks up from what I think to be a clean carpet. I bought one for myself and talked my father in law into purchasing one for their home as well and he is amazed when I clean his house weekly at just how much stuff ends up in the canister. I love the way the head swivels to easily get under furniture and the ease of use. Also, love the fact that I can lift off the canister and carry it with the tools to get in hard to reach places. I could do my own info commercial on this product. In fact, I bought a 2nd one that I'm keeping in the box just in case something goes wrong with my first one.

I loved my Shark. It really picked up the dirt deep in the carpet. I know because it took no time to fill up the canister. The Shark began to give me electrical shocks and I really thought maybe it had something to do with static in the air but it got worse. I had to be careful where I touched the vacuum when vacuuming. Then one day it stopped shocking me - the same day the roller brush stopped working. I have contacted the company with no response. I owned my vacuum for only 3 months. This is the first expensive vacuum I have owned and what a waste of money. I will return to buying less expensive vacuums. Would rather have 3 $60.00 vacuums than one good one that is defective. Wish I had kept the receipt.

My husband and I purchased a Shark Navigator Lift-Away Pro, Model Number NV355 approximately nine months ago. Within only a few months, the brush roll began to rattle and even when completely cleaned, the vacuum would only work on carpets for a few minutes. I called on January 7th to use the warranty to replace or repair the unit. I was notified at the time that my only two options were to either spend an additional $100 for a new vacuum, or pay nearly that same amount in shipping and handling for the vacuum to be sent to the ONLY repair location in the country, California. My husband and I are both military, and money is extremely tight. I fail to see the value of a warranty that penalizes customers after less than a year of owning a vacuum that DOES NOT WORK.
I voiced my concerns to the phone operator, Julianne, and requested to speak to a manager. Julianne notified me that there were no managers currently working, which I found incredibly difficult to believe. I then requested to speak with a District Manager. Julianne again stated that not only could she not connect me with that individual, but she did not even have their information. She told me that I would be contacted by a manager within 24-48 hours. I waited over five days before hearing anything, receiving a voice mail during a family emergency.
After settling our family affairs, I called the number back on January 29th, and was told that the same manager, (Sarah), who attempted to contact me in Mid-January was currently coming back from lunch and that I would have to hang up and she would call me back in 5-10 minutes. While someone did call back, I was unable to reach the phone. I called back immediately and was notified by another phone representative that they had absolutely no idea who Sarah was, that there were no managers currently working, there was no method for telephone operators to transfer a call to a manager, and that I would have to hang up and wait another 24-48 hours for a manager to get in contact with me.
I would like to state that this is the absolute WORST business model I have EVER heard of concerning customer support. The point of a customer like myself calling implies that this is the time they are available to talk about the problem they are having, being forced to wait for an arbitrary phone call that may or may not even happen implies that Shark does not care about their customers or their integrity. Being told several times that there were no managers currently working, and even if they were working, the phone representatives have no method of getting in contact with them alerts me to the possibility that Shark may not be operating within the standards of federal law. Not only is the Shark vacuum the worst vacuum I have ever bought, but its warranty is worthless and calling the customer help line is an exercise in futility. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY, YOU WILL REGRET IT!

I had a shark navigator. It was only a couple years old. I found it had a 5 year warranty. Something inside broke (I could hear it rattling); it's the 'kickstand' feature that allow the vacc to 'click into place' and (for lack of a better description), pop a wheelie so you can wheel it around. The bottom part (called the power nozzle) just kind of flopped off the end of the unit. You have to pick the whole thing up to move from room to room. So... trying to first take care of it myself (rather than, I presumed, ship it somewhere and leave me without a vacc for x# of days), I brought it to my local vacc repair shop. They couldn't fix it but showed me the part that had cracked, and advised me to contact the manufacturer for repair. So I called... and (trying to be helpful) told them I knew what was wrong with it - I had saved them some time and brought it somewhere. DEAD SILENCE.
"You what???" "I brought it to a vacc place". "Well - you just voided your warranty." WTF? I said "are you kidding," he said NO. Seriously??? I said "well let's pretend this conversation didn't happen and I'll call back." No can do. BOY this 'helpful agent' (not) was being really hard-nosed. Bottom line: they would not honor the warranty! Merely because I did some advance legwork. They offered to sell me a replacement (probably refurbished), for $29.99. NO THANK YOU.
A few months later my niece had the same problem with hers (bought around the same time). I said "don't take it anywhere" so she didn't. She called and reported it. After a long conversation the 'helpful agent' said "I'll just send you a whole new unit." A new vacuum? YES! (she figured by now there were lots of people complaining about this). The box arrived. The co. only sent a POWER NOZZLE! She called the company and they refused to honor the promise made by the agent. They said "we don't send new vacuums out for free" (but this is to replace their defective unit!).
They offered to sell her a new one at a reduced price - $70 or so. This was a classic bait and switch. (don't they realize there is more to lose, by not honoring what the agent promised to do? If they'd sent a new vacc we would both be singing their praises, I would be writing a glowing review... instead of me writing this novel).
So she is stuck with just the new brush attachment. IN ADDITION TO THIS, this company is NOT reachable by email, you can't reply back to the transaction receipts they send, and the 'live chat' is worthless when the person/robot you are live-chatting with... keeps referring you to their 800 number. I will not be buying another one of their products and neither will my niece.

I ordered the Shark Rotator Power Lift-away vacuum online directly from Shark on 1/15/15. I immediately received an email stating my order was on backorder with no estimate for delivery given. Today almost two weeks later I called phone number in my email, was only able to use the automated system still on backorder with no estimated delivery date. I tried several times to speak to a human but my call would somehow always end before I was connected.
Meanwhile I continue to see the infomercials on TV several times every day. I called the number to order and the saleslady had no knowledge of the backorder situation, as far as she knew the product was available. I told her I had been unable to speak to anyone when I called the customer service number so she offered to connect me, same problem I was never connected to a human, grrr! I finally used the live chat link from my email and after a lengthy wait an agent came online. I asked her if I made an order by phone and canceled my online order if I would get it sooner. She said, no it would be on backorder either way. She estimated my order would ship in 4-6 weeks!
I have not been charged any money as I paid through PayPal and won't be charged until it ships, thank goodness. Most website tell you upfront if a product is on backorder. It seems unethical to keep taking orders that won't be filled for that long without telling the customer upfront. Anyone considering ordering this should be warned you may be waiting to get your order for much longer than when you order from most companies.

CUSTOMER SERVICE.... First attempt: I was attempting to acquire the mailing address to send in my Shark vacuum for repair. The power head stopped working and was informed I needed to send in the entire unit. Try and find a box to ship, what fun and 36 dollar shipment.
I was assisted (She was Okay) and was told I needed to call customer service. The phone number I was given by the live chat person at about 1:30 MST (Amanda??) connected me to (1 800 798-7398) a national directory. After several minutes with her, I was transferred to C/S. A person named Valerie answered and I explained that I needed the address to send in my Shark vacuum for repair. With sub-standard phone connection I was able to get a partial address after several attempts. EURO something @ one something genesis way.
When I asked Valerie if she could send me the address via the email address I just gave her, she disconnected the call without an answer. After waiting for about 30 minutes for an email, I again attempted the live chat session to address my issue. I was third in line and after several minutes, I was connected with Julie. As I was typing in my request, my session was terminated. So far very lousy customer service over all.
I accessed Live Chat again (about 2:30 MST) and spoke with Jory. I explained I needed the address to send in my Shark Vacuum for repair. The person at Customer Service (Valerie) was not very helpful at all. I was able to get a partial address; EURO something at one something Genesis Way, Spring Pine, NC.28777. Jory was prompt and gave me the Address. WOW. For such an awesome product to have such lousy C/S... I am shocked. Please include my comments in your surveys. NOT HAPPY !!!

Bought a Shark Rotator Pro (NV502Q) about 6 months ago. The suction elbow release latch that holds the elbow in place vanished and needs to be replaced with about a 10 cent replacement piece. Went to the Shark online Chat and told them what I needed. I got the same response that another reviewer previously got and that was, for the 10 cent piece, I either needed to box up the unit and send it to them for repair and then pay the freight both ways - for them to snap on a clip! Of course, my other choice was to buy a new unit (REALLY?! ) at a discount. This is **! I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND A SHARK UNIT TO ANYONE AS A RESULT OF THIS EASILY AVOIDABLE SITUATION. THIS is what is wrong with the world. Poor judgement, poor diagnosis and solution to the problem. Wonder why things cost so much? I don't!

I ordered the vacuum the first of October. They said the first payment and shipping and handling would be taken out in the first 24 hours and the vacuum would be delivered in 4 to 6 weeks. Well, I waited and waited for the $105.00 to be taken out. So by December, when it still wasn't taken out, I decided I wasn't going to be getting it, so I used the money for Christmas. December 24th I got a surprise. I was overdrawn in my bank like $95.00. They had finally taken out the money without any warning. But on the bright side, I got the vacuum a few days later.

A small red button on the nv-501 model broke. It holds the hose elbow in place but with out it, the hose just comes out making the rather expensive vacuum nonfunctioning. I called customer support. They informed me that the small button was not a replacement price they offered. Now this small button could not cost 1/2 to 1 cent to make. So their solution was offer me a discount on a new unit of 75 dollars off. The vacuum is less then 6 months old. This is ridiculous and now I wish I would have popped the extra money for the dyson.

After 7 months the motorized floor brush rollers on my NV 355 failed to function. I called SHARK Tech Support and after several attempts to get the brush roller to work I was told that I would need a new motorized brush roller and it was NOT covered under warranty. $59.99 plus shipping and handling for a total of $75.00. 5-year warranty on what?

I contacted Euro (Shark) to purchase a vacuum for my daughter for xmas. I told them I was on a fixed income and wanted the payment deducted from my account on or around the 1st of the month, I was assured this would be the case. After receiving the email notification (3) out of the (4) months was before the 1st. I contacted Euro with my concern. I was told to cancel the order and replace it as this would reset the days so the payment would be deducted as I specified. I told the rep this was going to be a xmas gift and I had to have it arrive before xmas; "no problem," I was told. I contacted Euro on (3) occasions and each time I was reassured there would be no problem. I contacted them today xmas eve after discovering FedEx said it was shipped 12/22/14 @ 2:00 pm.
I contacted Euro. Fed Ex says its a Saturday delivery, now I am going to look stupid arriving without a gift, that's a fine merry xmas, thanks. Euro said "the order was not included in the air mail shipment." "And why was it not included, not a priority? I was promised it was going to be shipped." Euro said "unable to cancel your order because it has already shipped. You can return it under the 60 day money back trial period." Just forget it. I won't be ordering from Shark in the future. That's what is wrong with business today, the order was placed over 3 weeks ago. Just screw Shark. I will make it my journey to post these results.

My vacuum's motor started to go out and I called customer support - no resolution. And then it completely went out so I called customer support again and ask them what can I do about it. They asked me to send the vacuum back and my own expense. Then they offered me to get a discounted vacuum cleaner for $100 and I just felt as though why would I pay for another vacuum when there's clearly something wrong with my vacuum cleaner. I think their services suck and it's a rip off. I paid 200 dollars only to pay another hundred dollars. That's ridiculous.

I ordered a Shark Navigator Vacuum after watching the infomercial on television. I ordered it over the phone and ask for the six monthly installments of $49.95. I was told I would be charged the first monthly payment of 4995 before the vacuum would be shipped. I agreed and they assured me back it would be shipped within nine business days. The vacuum was delivered within the nine business days. When I receive my credit card bill I was charged the full amount of $389.50. I notified Shark of the error and was informed by Shark that there was nothing they could do to correct the problem. They told me that because it was already charged they could not correct the problem. They said the only thing they could do was give me a 20% discount off the total.
I do not understand why they cannot credit my account for the $389.50 and then charge me the monthly installments as promised. Unfortunately I did not read the customer reviews prior to my purchase. This was clearly a mistake made by Shark and not by me when the order was taken. It was also clear that the order taker over the phone told me I would be charged the first monthly installment prior to the back and being shipped so it was clear I was supposed to be charge monthly installments and not the lump sum. Obviously this is no way to do business. Unfortunately this has happened to me and would like other buyers to be aware. Also I would like buyers to be aware that they were unwilling to correct their mistake. Thank you for...

On Dec 2, 2014 the beater bar on my Shark professional Euro pro vacuum stopped turning. I called customer service and they asked me to turn it off/ then back on and press a button on the top. The beater bar still was not working. They said that they would send me a new motor/ beater bar unit. It arrived on Dec 19, 2014 and I put the top part of my vacuum cleaner onto it and it cranked right up! I just got finished vacuuming my whole house. They did not want me to ship the old unit to them. It seems that the problem is not a broken belt, but rather an electrical switch that fails over time. I'm sure they have had to replace enough of these units to cause them to find another switch provider. Great vacuum!!! The only improvement I would suggest is for them to sell replacement filters at Walmart.

I was watching a info commercial advertising the Shark Vacuum Pro vacuum sweeper. They advertise all the great extras you will get with the offer, but hurry in the next 3 minutes or you "will miss out" on this offer. I got online, ordered the vacuum for $300. I got my email confirmation and discovered they charge you $56 to ship your vacuum and oh by the way....back ordered for 6 weeks. I got on the live chat and the lady tells me it will ship on the 17th of December. Checked today. 6 Weeks. What a rip off to advertise this awesome deal and hurry, but you will have to wait 6 weeks. I guess I need to go to Home Depot and buy a $39 shop vac and clean up the house.

I have had my $200.00 vacuum for about 2 years and have thought I made a good purchase until now. The brush stopped rotating so I took it in to be repaired. Well Shark only sells parts to consumers. What good does that do me? I don't fix vacuums! Not to mention the fact that it needed repaired anyway. So when I went to pick it up they said that the motor that turns the brush had gone out, so I have to call the company and order the new $70.00 part and fix it myself. IF I choose to do that I will have almost spent $300.00 for this vacuum because I also had to replace the furniture attachment because it broke also. I SHOULD HAVE BOUGHT A DYSON.

I have a Shark hand held vacuum, similar to the Dirt Devil. This thing is a piece of junk. (Language filter fully on!) I can only use it for five minutes before it overheats and stops. The Shark customer service contact told me to make sure the filter is clean. What? Every time I use the damn thing? (Language filter only working at 50% level.) I also complained about my upright vacuum and Shark immediately sent a replacement end for the vacuum. Kind of leads me to believe that there was a problem and Shark only dealt with it when confronted by a customer. These things are pieces of CRAP! YOU DO NOT WANT ONE!

SHARK PRODUCTS ARE THROW AWAY JUNK, December 6, 2014. This review is from: Shark Navigator Upright Vac (Kitchen). Shark products are all GARBAGE. We have owned a few, suckered to purchase by their slick advertising, and ALL were JUNK after a short period of time. A very poorly made product in the most general sense.
This company personifies the throw away mentality, but even so, it should not be shortly after purchase. These products are made to last as long as it takes you to exit the store. Keep your receipt. I bought some at Bed, Bath and Beyond because they have a very consumer friendly return policy, and I knew they would take them back when they broke, or in the case of the handhelds, when the battery stopped charging. We went to Dyson and have been pleased

I have been watching the TV commercials and felt this was the right vacuum to purchase. I went online to make the purchase and was wanting model NV650. It said it came with the following: (cut and pasted) Powered Lift-Away, Vacuum pod detaches allowing you to reach under the lowest spaces with a powerful motorized floor nozzle, TruePet Mini Motorized Brush Attachment, 3 Vacuums In One, Hard-Floor Genie Attachment, Shark Anti-Allergen Complete Seal Technology + HEPA / Washable Filters, and Cleans Bare Floors.
When I went to purchase all the attachments were missing in the itemized section. So I called and they told me that would cost me another $100 dollars, even though they advertised it as $249 total for this model with attachments listed. Online chat disconnected me when I asked to speak to manager. Rep was just reading from script. I even cut and pasted their own advertisement from their own website and it meant nothing to the rep. I tried to call the 800 number and got the same response. I was transferred to another department and hung up on before they even took the call. I was excited to buy this vacuum but refuse to give my money to a company that has no respect for its customers. I believe this is called bait and switch! I will pay the extra and buy Dyson.

Shark cordless 18-volt less than 9-months old. The rotator attachment stopped rotating so I removed the four screws to identify any problems. Just like any standard upright vacuum that has a rotating brush, it was manufactured with a BELT to rotate the brush head. Any other vacuum offers replacement belts. It's normal wear and tear as they begin to stretch out. I called the Mfg direct and they do not sell the belts alone, instead they only offer a replacement rotator assembly for 27.95 which includes shipping. The whole vacuum itself only cost $60. I feel that this is fraudulent marketing of a product and will be forwarding to the Attorney General's office for investigation.

I purchased my shark on 5/18/2013 for $297 and it has already stopped working on 11/21/2014. A little over 1 year and the vacuum is broke. I contacted Shark about their 5 yr VIP warranty and was told that I have 2 options: 1.) to ship it back to them and have a new one returned to me at my own expense or 2.) they will give me a discount on the purchase of a new vacuum. I'm sorry but what good is a warranty if I have to pay for shipping which will most likely cost me $80+. I would strongly recommend buying a vacuum from a local retailer and purchasing their extended warranty. That way, you can bring it back whenever there's an issue.

Do not buy this product!! You cannot change a broken belt. Instead you have to replace the lower part of the vacuum. $59.95 for the assembly and you pay shipping too. Rip off! Buy a $50 Bissell...they last about a year. And you can actually replace the belt.

I purchased the vacuum cleaner one year ago. It had from the beginning some suction problems but yesterday it blow up with sparks flying everywhere. If we did not have a circuit switch I would have been electrocuted!!!! It is suppose to have a ten year guarantee and we have sent off the warranty. Now I just want my money back, it is just not good business to claim what a great product you are buying and I am disappointed in myself for even getting now. Trying to get hold of the company and as usual cannot get hold of anyone. I need to have the warranty and docket that I sent to claim money back! I am fed up with advertising of how great items are and I have never brought anything before until the Shark hit Big W.

The unit has a serious flaw regarding its upright stability if you are using it only as a carpet cleaner. It works fine but if you disconnect the suction hose from the base and start using an attachment it will fall straight over and often will bash you on the back of the head along with anything else in its reach.

I will say on the positive side of this issue, that I have loved the performance of my Shark Navigator. I need a replacement belt, and they are not available! This is the first vacuum I have owned where I could not replace a simple belt!! I can't even buy one. I was told by a company rep. that I would need to replace the whole bottom part of the unit, and at $59.95, plus shipping and ten days wait period to have it delivered, I may as well buy a new one. I will be buying a vacuum with replaceable belts this time....not a Shark. I also said I wanted to answer the survey at the end of the call, and the rep. said that she was transferring me, and I was disconnected!!....Imagine that!!
