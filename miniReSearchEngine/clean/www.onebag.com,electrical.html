Cantabit vacuus coram latrone viator.

What To
Pack
Electrical Products
Things that must be plugged in are in conspicuously short supply on my own personalpacking list; they add bulk and weight rarely compensated for by usefulness. Try hard to eliminate them.
If, however, you just can't live without your electric shaver (a small bottle of
shaving oil
and a razor are much more appropriate), or your hair dryer (think about towel/air drying, or even a more travel-friendly hair style), don't forget that electrical power varies throughout the world.
Most countries use 220240 volts AC (alternating current) at 50 Hertz (frequency, aka cycles per second), though severalincluding Canada, Japan, and the U.S.A.use 110120 volts at 60 Hertz. Moreover, there are more than a dozen styles of wall socket, each requiring a different type of plug.
Plug adapters
and
voltage converters
are available for all of this, of course (
Walkabout Travel Gear
is a particularly well-equipped and helpful source of such devices); also check the "
Destination
" section of the TraveLinks page for an excellent information site). Remember that, when using converters, you must also be concerned with power (wattage) ratings. And some devicesoften those with motorsare sensitive to the AC frequency, which cannot (in any practical manner) be converted.
Plug adapters can be found featuring all sorts of ingenious constructions, such as the "
Tripshell Universal Travel Adapter
" (pictured at left), which provides configurable plug adaptation for some 150 countries worldwide. It incorporates a 6A fuse (which means it will handle 660W @ 110V, 1440W @ 240V), L-N surge protector (to isolate sensitive electronics from potential power spikes), 110/230VAC voltage indicators, and child safety shutters. These can be a convenient solution if you're travelling to many parts of the world on a single trip, but for a modest number of destinations, simple single-solution adapters will be smaller, lighter, and considerably more reliable.
Many products (especially modern electronic devices such as computers, cameras, and cellphones) are available with "universal" power supplies or multi-voltage settings; you'll still need plug adapters, though. And remember: if you carry electrical devices that must be plugged in, you should be prepared for a shortage of available outlets (often in limited-supply/high-demand locations such as airports and hostels); consider bringing along a
cube tap
or the equivalent, to help both you
and
your fellow travellers.
If you choose to travel with a device having a 120/240V
switch
, get into the habit of switching it to 240V when you pack it: should you mistakenly plug it into a 240V socket when set to 120V, you will have an ex-device.
The various cables associated with electronic devices (some of which are considered in the
Specialty Items
section of the OneBag packing list) are notorious sources of unnecessary bulk and weight, and attract unwanted attention from security personnel.
Companies like
CableJive
(one of their Apple cables is pictured at left) and
Kurze Kabel
are useful suppliers of short cables to help reduce this problem.
If you've become wedded to a smart phone or other portable device, and your travels take you to places where electrical outlets are in shortor nonexistentsupply (this can even include long flights and road trips), you need to think about carrying a spare battery, something more easily managed with some devices than others. One popular solution is the Anker Astro series of portable, rechargeable power packs; even their
very largest (10,000mAh) model
(pictured at right), capable of charging one or two USB-connected devices at a 3-ampere level, is a quite compact 5.62.830.55 inches (14.57.191.4cm), and weighs a tolerable 8.48 ounces (240g).
A number of low-power electrical items, such as battery and cell-phone chargers, can be obtained in USB-powered versions, reducing the need to carry separate (heavy, bulky) converters. If you lug a laptop, you can plug them in there, though many modern televisions come with USB ports as well, so check the one in your hotel room.  And those toting a large collection of high-tech gadgetry might find benefit in the wide variety of adapters & chargers at
iGo.com
. But you can best eliminate the hassles by eliminating the gadgets.
Even if a hair dryer
does
make a great sock dryer.
