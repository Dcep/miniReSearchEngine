Groundbreaking Electron Condensor Technology
Introducing the worlds first energy efficient pool pump with electron condensor technology.  Breakthrough condensor technology stores electrons in a dielectric until the power is called upon.Then when the motor rotates into the optimal position, the stored energy is released, boosting the energy transferred to the impeller.  The result is maximum energy reduction, up to 80% over traditional pool pumps. Read more about the benefits of energy efficient pool pumps at

Beats the ROI on Variable Rate Pool Pumps
Until now...pool owners have had to choose between affordability and energy efficiency.  Regular single-speed pool pumps are inexpensive, but they're power hogs -using 2,000 watts of power or more. Most variable speed pumps are efficient but reliablity is poor and prices are high.  That's because they require specialized programmable/digital controllers. The costs of these controllers often bring total costs to $1,500. - $2,000. Those complicated electronic circuits are known to fail early and repairs can be as much as a new pump! For more info on this known problem, perform a Google search for: [variable speed + poor warranty + unrepairable].  With EcoPump, no expensive controller is required.  EcoPump can be controlled with a simple time clock, an ordinary power  switch, or any existing control system. It's the best of both world's in the top rated energy efficient pool pump.

All Pool Pumps Should Run 24 Hours Per Day for Best Water Quality
Now you can run your pump twice as long, for half the cost.  In the past, many pool owners ran their pumps just 4-8 hours per day to reduce their electric bill.  Thats great for utility bills, but 16-20 hours of stagnant water is not good for water quality.  Stagnant water is a breeding ground for bacteria and algae.  It's important to note that commercial pools are required to filter their pools for 24 hours in most states.  24 hour filtration is directly related to higher water quality and reduced chemical demand.  Plus equipment such as
pool controllers
,
pool automation
, and
ultraviolet disinfection systems
can all keep working around the clock for the highest water quality.

Calculate the Green Factor on Any Pump
Its important to note that there are no set standards when it comes to energy efficient pool pumps and no energy efficiency ratings.  Unfortunately, this makes it difficult for pool owners to compare one pump to another.  To further complicate matters, some companies use the words energy efficient and high efficiency in their marketing for pumps that are inefficient.  The good news is that its easy to calculate how much power a pump will use.  Simply multiply the pumps amp rating by 230 and divide by 1,000.   Now you know the Kilowatt rating which makes it easy to compare with other pumps. If you would rather skip the math, visit
