Compact refrigerators are the right size to use space efficiently. They primarily store and chill beverages and snacks in game rooms, garages, and bedrooms. The drawback to their small size is that a
mini fridge
sometimes uses more energy than a
full-size refrigerator
, according to a Consumer Reports review. The actual cost to run a mini fridge depends on several factors, including the size of the refrigerator and the number of hours in use. Consumers can learn to calculate the average annual cost to run a mini fridge before purchasing.
Reasons for High Energy Use
On average, a standard model mini fridge uses roughly 230 kilowatt-hours per year, as much as many Energy Star rated
full-sized refrigerators
. The amount of energy a mini fridge consumes is due in large part to poor insulation and lack of cooling features.
Poor Insulation
Due to their small size, mini fridges have greater surface area per cubic foot than full-size refrigerators and less room for insulation. This leads to the generation of more heat, and that increases the interior temperature. The end result is that a compact refrigerator requires more energy to keep the interior cool.
No Cooling Features
Full-size refrigerators use external condensers and fans to dissipate heat. In contrast, mini refrigerators use their external walls to dissipate heat, and this leaves them more sensitive to room temperature. Compact refrigerators in warm rooms use more energy than those used in cooler locations.
Calculating Energy Costs for a Mini Fridge
With the number of variables that factor into appliance energy consumption, it is difficult to predict how much energy a mini fridge may use. However, there are ways to estimate energy use and cost based on the wattage ratings of appliances. Additionally, many appliances include energy rating tags that offer rough yearly estimates for consumers who do not want to do the math themselves.
Energy Guide Labels
The Federal Trade Commission requires Energy Guide labels on
appliances
such as refrigerators,
washers
, televisions, water heaters, and
dishwashers
. These bright yellow tags provide estimates for annual yearly operating costs based on national averages for usage and energy costs. Energy Guide labels show consumers the range of operating costs for similarly equipped models. Appliances that meet specific criteria for energy efficiency receive an Energy Star rating on their labels. Calculated figures for popular models include averages based on testing in controlled conditions.

There is very little variance in total energy use among these compact refrigerators, despite a large size difference between the smallest and largest models. However, per cubic foot, the smaller refrigerators use much more energy than the larger models.
Energy Use Calculation
With a few simple calculations, consumers can estimate the operating costs of various mini fridges, even if there is no Energy Guide label attached. Each appliance rates at a specific number of watt-hours. For instance, many mini fridges rate at roughly 100 watt-hours. To find the cost of operation per hour, the consumer divides the watt-hours of the refrigerator by 1,000 and then multiplies that number by the cost per kilowatt-hour of electricity obtained from the local utility company. To calculate annual cost estimates, the consumer multiplies the cost per hour by the number of hours per week (168 hours if constantly running) and multiplies that answer by 52, the number of weeks in a year.
How to Buy a Mini Fridge on eBay
Consumers who want to purchase mini fridges for their game rooms, bedrooms, or other entertainment spaces can find a wide variety of choices on
eBay
, often at very competitive prices. eBay's intuitive interface and user friendly search features make shopping a breeze. Consumers have the option of searching by brand, color, condition, energy rating, and more. Category and filter options make locating the right model simple. Shoppers can eliminate shipping charges by searching for items with free shipping or limiting search results to items within their local areas.
Conclusion
Although mini fridges consume a disproportionate amount of energy, most consumers do not notice the slight increase in their electricity bills because most compact refrigerators cost less than $5 per month to operate. For most people, the convenience of having cold beverages readily available when playing games or watching sports in garages or basements is often enough to justify the extra cost. Consumers can manage energy consumption by choosing models with Energy Star ratings and keeping the rooms with the fridges as cool as possible.
