HB2334 pool pump energy standards; repeal
(Montenegro) repeals the more efficient pool pump standards that significantly reduce energy use and save consumers dollars. This was tried last session, but did not advance.
Old, inefficient pool pumps are a drain on our pocketbooks. Requiring more efficient pool pumps helps Arizonans save on their electric bills and reduce energy consumption, water consumption, and air pollution. Some people have said these standards are a hardship, but that is just not well-founded in reality. The standards have been in effect for over a year and there has been no significant negative fallout from them.

Background
The i
ncremental cost for the high-efficiency pool pumps (two-speed per the standard) is approximately $200
.
Installation of one of these pumps results in an annual energy savings of about
1,300 kilowatt-hours (kWh) and a cost savings of about $130 each year, assuming that the electricity cost is about$0.10 per kWh.
The simple payback on these pumps is less than two years.
Overall, these standards will save Arizona Public Service and Salt River Project customers more than $100 million by 2020.
Energy efficiency is the cleanest, cheapest energy resource available.
It helps us
keep jobs and money in Arizona and s
aves us money on our bills immediately. It also saves us money in the long run by ensuring that we dont pay for the construction of unnecessary power plants and transmission lines.
The Legislature should support energy efficiency because it contributes to a strong economic environment in Arizona.
Energy efficiency is a net positive for the economy, and our environment as it helps reduce pollution and water consumption, plus it keeps more of our energy dollars in our state.
