Other than "full power" and "defrost" do you use any other microwave setting?

I don't, and I don't recall ever seeing anyone else ever microwave something on anything other than full power or defrost. Do you use any of the other settings?

The only buttons I ever press is the 30-second quick start and the stop button. I have no idea what any of the other buttons do.

Same here. There seem to be all sorts of possible settings, but I've never used them.

My microwave's power setting is in 10 increments, 1-10, and I use most of them. Power Level is the first button I hit, before entering the time. I never before thought this was unusual.

My oven only has two settings, full power and defrost. Besides those there's the dial to set the time and that's it.

I've started using lower power settings than max to steam vegetables for cooking. (I like my carrots mushy.) 3 minutes at max, then stir, then 10 minutes at power level 3, stir again, 10 minutes at power level four. Then they're ready. ;)

I actually never use defrost.
I do use the 50% and 80% power settings when cooking rice and pasta.

Potatoes get cooked at a (1-9 settings) power level 4.
Popcorn has its own button! ;)

Mine has various 'Reheat' settings, which, along with the 'Popcorn' option, are actually the ones I use most often. I think I've only used defrost a half a dozen times in ten years. I've used full Warp Factor 10 power quite a bit more than that, however.

And what's that popcorn button for? :confused: Nearly every microwave popcorn I've ever used has said NOT to use the popcorn setting.

Our microwave oven is a Panasonic Genius II (similar to the one shown here (http://forums.redflagdeals.com/how-long-can-i-use-my-seemly-working-microwave-oven-before-unsafe-984887/)) from the early 1980s. It's got a table on the front listing the various things that can be cooked automatically using the built-in programs.
To start it normally, you have to select among 5 power levels, then select the duration. We frequently use levels 5 (max), 4 and 3.

I mainly use full power or defrost, but at least once a week I'll set the exact power level I want. Usually it's for something that's difficult to defrost or something I want cooked a particular way.

I use the power levels all the time, especially when reheating foods.  I'll double the time and put the power at 50%, so things heat more evenly.
We also use the Beverage button, which is handy to get a hot beverage that isn't going to explode when you put the sugar in.

I use the beverage button, the popcorn button, and power level 3 (for reheating pizza or any bakery item, including warming up cookies) in addition to full power.

I do that with the baby's food.  I'm never sure whether 1 minute at 50% is really any different from 30 seconds at full power, though.
I've also had good luck with the Potato button, at least when I'm cooking potatoes.

3 minutes on power 2 defrosts two boned and skinned chicken thighs to perfect dicing firmness. I add cumin, garlic, cayenne, and black pepper.  I then cook the chicken and make awesome tacos.

Ditto. Additionally, I use lower setting when making rice or oatmeal (full power initially, and then lower power to cook).

the numbers only have some meaning when full number range the power of the oven is stated.
intermediate numbers can work well with large volumes to heat thoroughly without stirring and not burn.

That sounds like CYA language to me. The popcorn companies realize that there are people out there who will just throw the bag in, push the button, and leave it, when in fact, it isn't that precise and needs to be monitored. I use the popcorn button on my microwave and there is usually at least 30 seconds left when I take it out, well long enough to burn it if left for the complete cycle.
As for the OP, in addition to full power, defrost, and popcorn, I use the reheat settings, the potato setting, and I experiment with various power levels to avoid overcooking the edges of things.

Mine has lots of buttons. The ones I use a lot:
Rice
Baked Potato
Veggies - Fresh / Frozen
Butter - Soften / Melt
Reheat - 1 Dinner Plate - 2 Soup/Sauce - 3 Casserole - (there is a 4 but I don't know offhand what it is)

I use "warm" for melting butter. My oven is ancient (it has dials!) so timing is hit or miss.

Microwaves vary considerably in power. If you have something other than a $50 Wal*mart dorm-room special, it probably has more power than a little box.
I frequently use longer times at 50% power on things that are not entirely liquid. All or mostly water? Zap it at full power. Soup, chili or vegetables? They'll cook much better, with no dried edges, hot spots, boiling over and spattering at half power. You need to give the water-borne heat time to spread through the denser materials without boiling spots. I have other power levels I've learned to use with specific tasks and items. I'd have to relearn them with a new oven, even one of the same approximate power.
But other than that, and the 30-seconds-per-press quickstart, I don't think I've ever used a microwave preset. They're kind of the successor to "18-speed blenders" and the like. Can't think of a time I've tried one and it worked satisfactorily.

I asked a similar question back in '07.  Some of the same people respond back then too (silenus)
Why 10 power levels on microwaves? (http://boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/showthread.php?t=434503)

For some reason (probably, in my mind, an effort to avoid mishaps) I generally prefer to run mine at about 30% for more minutes instead of at full power for fewer. That's the one I have at home. At work I use it at 100% (for less time) because A) there are other people using it at work besides me, B) I have more of a time constraint when I'm having lunch at work than I generally do when I'm at home, and C) the one where I work right now has a messed up display which makes it pretty hard to read. Set time and "Start" is all I bother to do with that one.

I mostly use the full power one minute quick button. If it's a frozen dinner I'll punch in the minutes. I've tried to figure out how to do 5 minutes at 50% but it's hopeless. All the "hotdog" type presets are useless to me. Can't get them to work. My old microwave had a 2.5 minute popcorn present that worked, but my current one doesn't. Maybe it does. I don't know.

I find that certain prepackaged microwave soups and noodles are designed for a lower power microwave and will boil over on full power. So I cook those at 80% power.

You need to give the water-borne heat time to spread through the denser materials without boiling spots. I have other power levels I've learned to use with specific tasks and items.This is my method as well.  When reheating lunch at work or leftovers from last night, even most soup or chili, two minutes at 50% is usually just right.  If it is particularly liquidy or something like a cup of coffee, max power.  I'm also fairly strict on covering the food with a glass or porcelain bowl and letting it sit for a bit after the two minutes.  If the bowl is hot to the touch when time's up, the food is probably ready.

Pastrys like doughnuts do better at 50% for 15 seconds. The glaze falls off if your overheat them. A day old pastry tastes so much better heated.
I use 50% to soften butter. Most things I heat at 100%.
I don't know how to use defrost mode on my new microwave. Never needed it that badly. Theres some pre-programmed modes for specific foods that I never have used either.

In answer to the OP, nope.  And I only use a microwave at work, as I don't own one myself.

Sometimes I use the timer button if I'm cooking something in the oven, because the dog HATES the sound of the oven timer when it goes off.  So it's easier to use the microwave one.

Buttons we use:
Add 30 sec
2 minutes
3 minutes
(none of the other buttons on the number pad work so if you want more than 3 minutes you have to keep adding 30 sec.)

I use low power (1 or 2) for melting butter. Trying to use anything else is suboptimal.
I also use the reheat button a lot, it's nice for leftovers.
PunditLisa
04-25-2014, 11:44 PM
I use "Reheat" all the time.
I use "Popcorn" and "Vegetables - Baked Potato" a lot.
I also use "Add 30 seconds."
And of course, I use the Timer constantly.

I have a circa 2000 Sharp Sensor that has preset buttons for different things like pastry, frozen pastry, frozen vegetables, frozen dinner, popcorn, potatoes, warming drinks, and defrosting by the 1/2 pound and for different meats. It works wonderfully, I don't know how it does it. It's like a little white magic box in my kitchen. It doesn't have some pre-set time for things like frozen dinners; it seems to sense a certain amount of steam or something, and doesn't put a time on the display until it "knows" there's 1 or 2 minutes remaining, it's always different (but the same for the same dinners).
I do my own timing and percentages for delicate things like melting butter or softening cream cheese without exploding. Usually 30%.

I occasionally use defrost.  What I mainly use are 1,...,5 which run it at highest setting for that many minutes (I cannot find a microwave now that has that feature) and the 30 sec button which both adds 30 seconds or runs for the 30 sec.  I never cook anything in the microwave.
Missy2U

I rarely use it, but when I do, it's Beverage - 1 (for tea), Defrost (I forget the different options) and Frozen Entree - 10 oz. (I just used it to reheat frozen lasagna.)

Our microwave has two settings: on and off. There are no buttons except for the one to open the door, only a knob that you turn to the desired time. To turn it off you turn the knob back to zero.

Always full power, I use the 30 sec. quick launch button a lot.
Side note: I don't remember where, but I read an article online about laziness and one guy wrote, "When I need to use the microwave for 1 minute I always push 1:11 because I don't feel like reaching all the way down to push the zero button."

Thanks to this thread, I have been experimenting with different power levels on the microwave. Turns out it's actually possible to make porridge in the microwave without it boiling over if you use a lower power setting for longer. Thanks to the SDMB, my mornings are much easier now.

I use 50% power almost all the time.  Think about your regular oven - 350 degrees is the most commonly used temp and that is considered to be medium heat.  You wouldn't reheat leftovers at 500 degrees in your oven, so don't reheat them at full power in your microwave either.
I only use full power if I have a frozen something and the instructions on the package say to do so, OR if I'm cooking something from a raw state and not simply reheating.
Guess what?  Leftovers still taste good when they are reheated properly!

I've never used defrost.
I use the power buttons when I reheat food or it would be hard in some spots and cold in others.
Otherwise it's full power (steamed vegetable bags, popcorn, boiling water).

This reminds me of back when I was in high school, and all my friends' mothers were signing up for weird "microwave cookery" classes.  They were new tech, and my family didn't have one.
Anyway, I ended up getting one as an adult in the 90s.  Cooking?  Ha!  Couldn't do jack with the things.  I've only ever used them for simply nuking the crap out of stuff.  Well, that's not entirely true - I've tried defrosting a few times, but it never seems to work.  I got burnt bits and still-frozen bits.  Nuking to heat stuff?  They are brilliant.  Anything else?  I'll use the stove top.

I don't, and I don't recall ever seeing anyone else ever microwave something on anything other than full power or defrost. Do you use any of the other settings?
I have a 1250-watt microwave, so when I'm cooking something with directions written for the standard 1100-watt models, I'll drop to 80% power. I've also used lower settings for tasks like softening butter. I don't normally use defrost because I dislike the results.
My microwave has a "sensor reheat" option that figures out time and temperature needed to heat my food for me. Nice when I'm not yet completely awake. :D

I mostly use the "add 30 seconds" button. But occasionally I use the power level button (60 or 70% usually) to reheat largish items like meatloafs or roasts.
