Household Emissions Calculator Assumptions and References
Your Current Household Emissions Sources
Household Vehicles
Pounds of carbon dioxide equivalent are calculated based on EPA's estimate of the
greenhouse gas emissions from a typical passenger vehicle
in the United States. Estimates of the typical values for fuel economy and miles driven per week are from the
Federal Highway Administration's Highway Statistics 2007 Table VM-1 (PDF)
(1 p, 11K)
. Note that EPA's emissions estimates are lower than estimates obtained through
fueleconomy.gov
, because EPA's estimates are for tailpipe emissions only. The fueleconomy.gov site estimates emissions over the full fuel lifecycle (including extraction, processing, and transportation of fuel).

Waste Disposal
Estimates of greenhouse gas emission benefits from recycling newspaper, glass, plastic, metal, and magazines were developed using national waste data and life-cycle greenhouse gas emission factors for waste management. Calculations assume that it would be possible for households to recycle 100 percent of all recyclable materials generated as waste. For example, if you indicate that you recycle newspapers, this calculator assumes that you recycle 100 percent of the newspapers you receive. It is estimated that on average, each person generates 0.025 tons of newspaper, 0.038 tons of glass, 0.015 tons of plastic, 0.011 tons of metal, and 0.005 tons of magazines per year.
EPA's annual Characterization Report was the source of per capita waste generation by material type (e.g., newspaper waste generated per person). Source:
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2010. Municipal Solid Waste Generation, Recycling, and Disposal in the United States: Facts and Figures for 2009 (PDF)

).
Carbon dioxide equivalent emissions associated with household waste management were calculated using the total emissions for landfills (including incineration, landfill gas-to-energy projects, oxidation, and flaring) from EPA's Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks, 1990-2009 and the United States population estimates from EPA's annual Characterization Report mentioned above. The emission factors for each material type were developed by EPA and presented in the Agency's report on greenhouse gas emissions from waste management and in the online WAste Reduction Model (WARM). These emission factors take into account the full material life cycle; i.e., not only emissions at the landfill, but also emissions and sequestration associated with production, manufacturing, remanufacturing, forest carbon storage due to reduced harvests, etc. The emission factor used for recycling materials in this calculator compares greenhouse gas emissions from recycling with those attributable to landfilling. This approach enables policy makers to evaluate, on a per-ton basis, the overall difference in greenhouse gas emissions between (1) recycling 1 ton of material and (2) manufacturing and then managing (post-consumer) 1 ton of the same material.
