Buy a powerful vacuum cleaner before they are BANNED: New EU rules 'will outlaw best models in 10 days because they're not eco-friendly'
Five of the seven Which? 'Best Buy' vacuum cleaners banned from September
EU says the rules will mean consumers will get better vacuum cleaners
Critics claim new rule will not save energy because households will have to use their vacuum cleaners for longer
Manufacturers will have to regulate themselves

Many of the best vacuum cleaners will be taken off the market from next month when a new EU rule comes into force banning the most powerful models
Households that need a powerful vacuum cleaner should act quickly before all of the models currently available sell out, consumer watchdog
Which?
warned.
From September 1, manufacturers will not be able to make or import vacuums with a motor that exceeds 1,600 watts.

Floored logic: Critics say the new regulation will not save energy because households will only  vacuum for longer to reach the same level of cleanliness
But Which? warned that many of the best models, which appear in its Best Buy tables, have motor sizes that exceed this.
Of seven awarded Best Buy status since January 2013, five have motors of more than 1,600 watts, it said.

The maximum wattage will be lowered even further to 900 watts by 2017. Current cleaners boast an average of 1,800 watts.
The move has angered manufacturers, who say it will do nothing to make cleaners more environmentally friendly and will simply reduce efficiency in the home.
THE VACUUM CLEANERS ABOUT TO BE SUCKED UP BY EC REGULATIONS
Five of top selling vacuum cleaners on Amazon.co.uk that will be banned when new regulations come in
1.
Numatic HVR200A Henry A1 Bagged Cylinder Vacuum Cleaner. 1,200W.

2.
Vax W90-RU-P Rapide Ultra 2 Pre-Treatment Upright Carpet and Upholstery Washer. 1,000W.

3.

4.

BANNED BY 2017
5.
Hoover Smart Pets SM1901 Bagless Upright Vacuum Cleaner. 1,900W.
BANNED BY SEPTEMBER
Critics say cleaners satisfying the new rule may use less power, but householders will have to use them for longer so they are likely to use the same amount of electricity in the long run.
For the first time, vacuum cleaners will have ratings from A to G for energy use, cleaning performance on carpets and hard floors and dust emissions.
But manufacturers will create their own labels and will be self-regulated. Which? warned that it is unclear whether the ratings will be tested at all by an independent third party.

It added that manufacturers that give themselves A ratings across the board often dont do so well in its own independent tests, while those that do not score as highly often do better in the Which? laboratories.
Which? only offers its list of endangered Best Buy vacuum cleaners to its paid subscribers.
But popular cleaners still on sale at the moment which would be outlawed by the new rule include a Bosch Power All Floor Bagged Vacuum Cleaner, a Miele S6210 2000 Watt Bagged Cylinder Vacuum Cleaner and the Panasonic Bagged Upright Vacuum Cleaner Black 2000w.
Despite his company not producing any vacuum over 1,400 watts, Sir James Dyson, the billionaire entrepreneur who pioneered bagless vacuums, is also angered by the proposal.
He says the eco-labels will be misleading because they will not take into account the cost and waste of vacuum bags and filters and will give an advantage to competitors who use bag technology.
He is seeking a judicial review of the proposal at the European Court of Justice.
As many as 126 million vacuum cleaner bags were sent to landfill last year alone, according to Dyson, assuming that all the bagged vacuum cleaners use one bag a month. But the cost to households and the environment is not factored in to the new EU labelling.
But the European Commission believes the new regulations will mean better vacuum cleaners for consumers.
As a result of the new EU ecodesign and labelling regulations, consumers will also get better vacuum cleaners
,
European Commission spokeswoman for energy Marlene Holzner said in a blog.
'In the past there was no legislation on vacuum cleaners and companies could sell poorly performing vacuum cleaners.

Now, vacuum cleaners that use a lot of energy, that pick up dust poorly, emit too much dust at the exhaust of the vacuum cleaner, are noisy or break down pre-maturely will not be allowed on the market anymore.
'This means a better cleaning experience and less time and money spent on vacuum cleaning.
The new measures will be extended to other appliances, including water pumps, water heaters and tumble dryers.
THE SURPRISE 'ENERGY GUZZLERS' HIDING IN YOUR HOME
Beware of frosty shelves: An inefficient freezer can be a drain on households' energy consumption
The European Commission is set to enforce rules that it says will make vacuum cleaners more energy efficient.
But could you have other surprise energy guzzlers hiding in your home? Here are a couple of common culprits:
A frosty freezer:
When was the last time you defrosted your freezer?
Unnecessary frost forces the freezer to work harder and so can push up energy bills.
It wont add much on a daily basis, but it can add 100-200 to bills over a year.
Spotlights:
We often think nothing of covering bathroom and kitchen ceilings with spotlights, but they can add a significant cost on to energy bills.
One reader Kim Fox-Johnson discovered a few halogen spotlights in her kitchen were costing her almost 100 a year to run.
She is now gradually replacing them with LED bulbs, which will cost her around 15 a year to run.

...AND A WAY TO USE PEOPLE POWER TO FIGHT BACK ON ENERGY BILLS
This is Money has joined 
forces with energyhelpline to launch The Energy Switch, which could help
 you save even more.
Readers can team up with thousands of other people and use their 
collective power to negotiate a unique offer on their energy 
bills.
This one-off special
 deal will give you the chance to switch to a cheaper supplier ahead of 
any winter energy price rises and turns
 the table on energy firms - rather than households having 
to hunt out a better price, they will be competing to offer you one.
The last collective switch by energyhelpline saw 50,000 people sign up and those who switched save 221 on average.
