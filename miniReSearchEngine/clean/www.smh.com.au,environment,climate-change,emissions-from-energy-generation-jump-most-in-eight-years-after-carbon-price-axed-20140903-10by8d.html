Dark clouds: Carbon emissions from the power sector are back on the way up.

Carbon emissions from the country's main electricity grid have risen since the end of the carbon tax by the largest amount in nearly eight years.
Data from the National Electricity Market, which covers about 80 per cent of Australia's population, shows that emissions from the sector rose by about 1 million tonnes, or 0.8 per cent, at an annualised rate last month compared with June.
That is the biggest two-month increase since the end of 2006, and came as a result of an increase in overall demand and a rise in the share of coal-fired power in the market, according to Pitt & Sherry's monthly Cedex emissions index.
"It is highly likely that the trend directions of electricity demand, generation and emissions seen in the last two months will become set in place," the consultancy said, adding that the emissions intensity of the power industry was rising after six years of falls.

Environment Minister Greg Hunt did not comment on the rise in emissions when contacted on Wednesday.
Australia's bipartisan goal is to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 5 per cent below 2000 levels by the year 2020. The government scrapped the two-year-old carbon price in July.
Greens leader Christine Milne said the figures are "yet more evidence that Tony Abbott has delivered for the big polluters".
"Every tonne rise in emissions is another wad of cash in a coal baron's pockets while driving extreme weather events that everyone else will pay the price of," Senator Milne said.
The share of black and brown coal in the national market rose to 73.3 per cent from a historic low of 72.9 per cent in July, and will probably rise further as gas and hydro start to shrink.
The addition of new wind and solar energy capacity is also about to grind to a halt with the industry anticipating the Abbott government will take an axe to the Renewable Energy Target.
The latest emissions figures come as the 20-megawatt Royalla solar plant, the country's largest solar farm to be added to the grid, was officially opened in the ACT on Wednesday.
About 370 megawatts of wind in NSW and Victoria and 170 megawatts of large-scale solar are under construction, but "after that, there's very little in the pipeline", Pitt & Sherry principal consultant Hugh Saddler said.
Emissions from the power sector account for the largest emissions share of any industry, making up about one-third of Australia's total. The industry is expected to see a rise of millions of tonnes of emissions in coming months as gas in Queensland starts to be diverted to exports rather than domestic use and the main hydro plants scale back output.
If Hydro Tasmania's production drops back to levels just after the last drought, output will be about 9 terawatt-hours a year down from about 12TWh levels before the end of the carbon price.
"If that switches to brown coal, it will be nearly 4 million tonnes" of extra emissions annually, Dr Saddler said.
The share of gas in the market was little changed last month from July at 13 per cent, while hydro's share dropped to 9.1 per cent from 9.3 per cent, Dr Saddler said.
Wind energy's share last month eased to 4.6 per cent from 4.9 per cent a month earlier. A windy July saw record wind energy production in the country.

I am a supporter of the carbon tax and I think it is reckless to abolish it, given the hard work in introducing something like this has already been done.
However I dont think this article explains how an increase in demand could be attributed to the abolition of the carbon tax. I have only just received a letter from my electricity provider saying I can expect to save about 7% on my bill. This has not caused me to run alter my behaviour and run around turning lights on in celebration

Dave - yes, given the carbon tax was repealed on 17 July, some 48 days ago, the suggestion that emissions have increased as a result seems a stretch.
How you could even measure such a difference in a small time frame is a challenge, but i'm sure we'll see many more "facts" like this over the next few years.

We do need to have a fair price on carbon which is something an ETS would give us. Unhappily the carbon tax was higher than that paid by other similar economies and as such was unfair. The Libs' Direct Action scheme is also costly but the experts say it is inefficient. The Libs need to swallow their pride and choose the best option.

It's probably from all those Million jobs they have created.
Agreed, it's a bit soon to justify such figures, but we will see a rise in emissions.
That's why the POC was a proactive way to address emissions initially- to change behaviour via the hip pocket nerve.
This is the most Luddite Govt of our modern times, deliberately treating RE and a reduction in emissions with such contempt clearly exposes the coal sniffers for what they are.
We will regret this regressive move and the world will react.
To think we were once proudly forging the way to a new energy future.

1 Because consumer behaviour is fed by perception and anticipation as much as concrete reality.
2.  Because in advance of the scrapping of the carbon price, the electricity generation industry has slowed down the move to non-coal sources.

Ordinarily you would have made a good point and I don't know exactly how they reach these conclusions, however it is possible by collecting data over the last 40 odd days and applying computer modelling and statistical techniques. I would have to presume they hire professional modellers and statisticians to work this out. I would say that's probably how it's done.

ACG - if direct action isn't implemented, all we'll have on the climate change front line is the RET and the CEFC.
Based on that - what are your impressions of the Carbon Farming Initiative, and should it be supported ?

Most of the CO2 Emmission reductions have occurred because our factories have shut down. Yet, it CT proponents see that as a good thing. But I take Hacka's point as being the most realistic. Makes many other comments here seem farcical.

DrPhil - you points are fair - perhaps the problem is the source data.  Generally speaking there's a lag effect in being able to measure ppm, emissions per tonne and other indicators.  If they're collected from the energy companies, well they likely report monthly so won't have even reported August stats yet (as at 3 September).
The models and sampling techniques you refer to are probably pretty smart, but they have to be fed by the source data.  48 days after the CT was axed, i'm rather sceptical that the source data is current and accurate.  But that's just opinion, no real evidence.

The facts are there in front of you - obviously you haven't read the article.
"Data from the National Electricity Market, which covers about 80 per cent of Australia's population, shows that emissions from the sector rose by about 1 million tonnes, or 0.8 per cent, at an annualised rate last month compared with June.
That is the biggest two-month increase since the end of 2006, and came as a result of an increase in overall demand and a rise in the share of coal-fired power in the market, according to Pitt & Sherry's monthly Cedex emissions index."
On what basis do you question published findings apart from the inconvenient truth of them?
