I read your article on
devices running up your energy bills
with great interest. How can I reduce the energy bills in our use of refrigerators. I have heard that most modern refrigerators with their modern energy saving techniques are supposed to save energy. But how about those that were manufactured, say, in the 1980s or before?
Some people switch off the refrigerator for a number of hours a day with the intention of reducing energy. But others say that this is a bad habit as the refrigerator uses double the energy to bring it to the required temperature levels. I have no idea what we should do in order to reduce energy bills when using a refrigerator.

Gavin Munro from Efergy, a manufacturer of energy savings devices, said it's a myth that switching off the fridge or freezer for short spells will save energy. "They aren't designed to be powered down regularly," he said. "When a fridge freezer is turned on again, the compressors that cool the appliance down use more energy than you would save."
There is also the food hygiene risk to consider.

But there are several ways to cut down the energy consumption of the appliance.
Use the most efficient temperature settings by setting your freezer at -18C and your fridge between 2C and 5C.
Leave space around the back of your fridge or freezer for air to circulate.
Make sure the back of your fridge is ventilated and dust free. Vacuuming this dust off 2-3 times per year can reduce energy consumption by up to 6%.
Tom Lock, a product expert at the Energy Saving Trust, said it is not recommended to switch off the fridge unless it needs to be defrosted.
"We wouldnt want people to switch a fridge on and off for a few hours a day for health reasons due to the food being kept in there," he said.
He added that older appliances are always less efficient than newer models. Replacing a 12-year-old fridge with a newer version could save around 11 in energy bills each year.
Its also worth considering the location of the fridge, making sure it avoids direct sunlight from outside or other sources of heat from inside the home.
Even the most obvious tips, such as not keeping the fridge door open longer than necessary nor placing hot food in the fridge, will help save energy in the home.
The average running cost for a fridge is 23.50 for the year, which is one of the highest for appliances in the home. But considering the fridge is nearly always switched on, the overall cost actually isnt too bad.
