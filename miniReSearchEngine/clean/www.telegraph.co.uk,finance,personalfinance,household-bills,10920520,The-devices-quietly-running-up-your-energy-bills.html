Most of us know that to cut our energy bills we should turn things like televisions and computer monitors off at the wall rather than leaving them in standby mode, which consumes power even when theyre not being used.
But smaller gadgets and appliances quietly running in the background could be pushing your energy bills up much faster than you realised.
The worst culprit in most homes is in fact a wireless router, which costs 21.92 a year on average while on standby, according to Ecotricity.
The green electricity company has compiled a list of the worst household offenders and the results may come as a surprise.
A laser printer for example costs 18.26 a year to leave on standby, while a desktop PC costs 3.65 and a plasma television costs 4.87.
