Energy Saving Options  Variable Speed Pumps
Versatility and performance best describe Centurys new V-Green variable speed pump motor with integrated timer. Capable of delivering superior energy savings of over 80% versus a standard single-speed motor, V-Green motors are well suited for pump applications ranging from 3/4 - 2.7 total horsepower (THP). Spurred by consumer interest in energy-saving products and government-mandated efficiency standards, the innovative V-Green variable speed ECM offers premium efficiency boosted by such features as Power Factor Correction, which raises overall efficiency while reducing input amps! The state-of-art user interface ensures programming ease and flexibility, with on-screen navigation, ergonomic selector switch, and pre-set programs for out-of-the-box operation. CenturysV-Green is Title 20** compliant and with three user-defined variable speeds is a superb choice for reducing energy consumption, for lowering overall pool ownership costs, and for satisfying regulatory requirements.
**
Californias Title 20 legislation states that pumps > 1HP (total) must be 2-speed or variable speed, and must have a control to default to low speed (i.e. timer)

Slash pump energy use by up to 90%, saving hundreds per year
Standard pool pumps can consume as much energy as all other home appliances combinedoften costing more than $1,000 per year! IntelliFlo

and IntelliPro

Variable Speed pumps can typically cut energy use up to 90%, generally saving up to $1,500 in utility costs annuallymore where rates are higher than average.*
Exclusive, advanced motor technology typically provides base savings of 30%
IntelliFlo and IntelliPro pumps use an exclusive permanent magnet motor (used in hybrid cars) in place of a traditional induction motor. Permanent magnet motors are fundamentally more energy efficient and provide a typical base energy savings of 30%.
Onboard intelligence with variable drive can deliver additional savings up to 90%
Pentair VS
Variable speed capability, digital controls, and proprietary software that allow custom programming of optimum pump speeds for specific tasksfiltering, heating, cleaning, spa jets, waterfalls, etc. The result is additional energy savings...up to 90% compared to even so-called high efficiency, single-speed, two-speed and multi-speed pumps that cannot be adjusted.
For virtually all applications, the optimum speed will be lower than the preset, unchangeable speeds of older pumps. Using slower speeds takes advantage of a fundamental pump law: slower is far more efficient. In fact, when pump speeds are reduced by half, energy consumption is just one-eighth of what was previously used.
The quietest pumps ever built
The exclusive permanent magnet motor that is so critical for energy savings is also a totally enclosed fan cooled (TEFC) design. This combination, along with slower operating speeds, is responsible for IntelliPro and IntelliFlo pumps being the quietest pumps you can install. At typical speeds you can barely hear them operating.
Longer trouble-free service life than conventional pumps
Advanced motor produces far less heat and vibration than traditional induction motors for dramatically longer equipment life. TEFC design protects against all threats posed by an outdoor environment.
Features built-in diagnostics that detect and correct conditions that cause premature failure, thereby protecting against overheating, freezing and voltage irregularities. IntelliFlo
VF
also detects loss of prime.
New Model with Added Safety Features
IntelliFlo
VS+SVRS
pump is the first pump with an integrated Safety Vacuum Release System (SVRS), which provides an important layer of entrapment protection. Its built-in controller and proprietary software detect blockage of the drain and automatically turn the pump off within seconds.
