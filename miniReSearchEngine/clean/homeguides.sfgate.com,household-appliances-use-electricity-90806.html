What Household Appliances Use the Most Electricity?
What Household Appliances Use the Most Electricity?
by Chris Deziel
Recycling your old, inefficient appliances saves energy and money.
The appliances that typically draw the most electric power are those that produce heat through electrical resistance, such as electric water heaters and dryers, but they aren't necessarily the most expensive appliances to run. Appliances that you use often, such as washing machines, and those that run continuously, such as refrigerators, can cost more to use in the long run. The most expensive appliances are older ones with inefficient motors, leaks and poor insulation.
HVAC Systems
Although it isn't, strictly speaking, an appliance, a residential heating, ventilation and air conditioning system is the king of power consumption. With a power draw that can be as high as 15 kilowatts, an HVAC system accounts for a whopping 44 percent of of the average energy bill. The efficiency of an HVAC system is measured by its Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio, which usually ranges from 13 to 23, with higher numbers denoting greater efficiency. Units that pre-date 1992 can have a SEER as low as 6, and they use -- and waste -- considerably more electricity than contemporary systems.
240-Volt Appliances
The most energy-intensive appliances are the ones served by 240-volt electricity. These include water heaters, which draw between 4.5 and 5.5 kilowatts, clothes dryers, which can draw up to 5 kilowatts, and electric ranges, which can draw 1 to 2 kilowatts. The rating for dishwashers with a dry feature can also be in the neighborhood of 2 kilowatts. Water heaters typically consume the most energy -- up to 14 percent of total energy costs -- because they cycle on and off continuously. An appliance's power draw is clearly indicated on a label affixed near its power terminals.
Refrigerators and Freezers
When you consider annual power consumption, refrigerators and freezers rank high on the list of power consumers, not because they have an overbearing power draw, but because they are in continuous use. Older refrigerators with poor insulation and inefficient compressors are higher on the list than modern, energy-efficient ones, and certain features add to the power consumption. These features include through-the-door ice makers, which increase energy consumption by up to 20 percent, and automatic defrosters, which can consume up to 40 percent more. A refrigerator with a freezer on the bottom consumes 16 percent less power than a side-by-side model.
Insulate and Save
More than half of a typical residential energy bill goes to heating and refrigeration, which is why proper insulation is so important. If heat can pass through the walls or ceiling, the central heating and cooling system works harder to maintain a comfortable climate, and the energy bill goes up. Locate gaps and fill them with insulation or caulk. Similarly, an insulation blanket around your water heater reduces the power it uses and lowers your energy bill, while replacing your antique refrigerator with a properly sealed, energy-efficient model adds to your savings.
