It's rare indeed to open a letter from a power company and find that it contains good news, yet that's exactly the happy surprise that most of us have experienced these past few weeks. The nice lady from my electricity retailer wrote to me personally to let me know that, thanks to the repeal of the carbon tax, I would now be saving a whopping 7 per cent on my power bills.
Damn those smelly greenies and their fellow travellers for the pain they have inflicted on ordinary Australian households! I immediately raced out and told the kids that Christmas was back on, thanks to good old Uncle Abbott, with a bit of help from Big Clive and that guy who threw the kangaroo poo.
Unfortunately, it's all utter nonsense. Not the stuff about Australian households being under financial pressure, for that much is certainly true. (OK, the bit about cancelling Christmas was a slight exaggeration, but it's good to keep the kids on their toes.) But the suggestion that electricity price increases have been primarily caused by the carbon tax is at best a distortion, at worst an outright lie.
Yet the average electricity bill for Australian households has doubled in recent years, even though, on average, we're actually using less power. So why the hike?

In fact, the biggest contributing factor has been rorting by electricity network companies. In a nutshell, the facts are as follows: in recent years these companies have spent massive sums of money on upgrading their infrastructure, things like power lines and poles. These upgrades were often unnecessary, and their estimated costs were frequently inflated, but the industry regulator allowed the networks to make large profits by passing those costs on to electricity retailers, who in turn handed them on to customers.
As investigative reporter Jess Hill recently wrote in
The Monthly
magazine, this over-investment might well be one of "the greatest rorts in Australia's history", yet most of us remain oblivious. And, instead of sending us friendly letters itemising exactly how much of our ballooning power bills were due to this monumental rip-off, electricity retailers have instead sent us reassuring missives, promising small, post-carbon price savings. So most of us simply accept the drivel, believing that our soaring power bills were caused by Juliar's Big Fat New Tax.
Of course, the Abbott government hasn't just got  rid of the carbon tax, they've also gone in to bat for coal, doing everything they can to boost the industry's fortunes, short of covering their bodies in coal dust, then dancing around singing the
I Love Coal
song. Yet Abbott's enthusiasm for the black stuff is not shared by the population at large. Indeed, polling has consistently shown that the vast majority of Australians support renewable energy, and that many of us would willingly pay a bit more for electricity that was generated sustainably. And this is the real tragedy of the great electricity rort; that it created unnecessarily large price increases, which were then used by Abbott and his climate-change-denying side-kicks to kill off a tax that would have promoted a result favoured by most people.
As if that's not bad enough, we have little choice but to continue financially supporting the very companies that are responsible for this catastrophe.
In our consumer society, we assume that if we're not happy with a product, then we can vote with our wallets, and buy from the competitor instead. But when it comes to power, we have few real alternatives. All electricity retailers have been forced to hand on their network costs, so switching retailers won't shield you from the rort. Here in Victoria, choices are further restricted by the fact that the vast majority of our electricity is generated by burning coal. You may not like it, but you are inevitably supporting that filthy, unsustainable industry every time you turn on a light.
Going "off the grid" is a possibility, but installing enough solar panels to achieve this is not always practical, and is unaffordable for many. Perhaps one could instead emulate the couple in that old BBC sitcom
The Good Life
, who converted their suburban backyard into a farm, then generated their own electricity using the methane from all the animal poo. Given that my family keeps only a single smallish cat, I doubt that we will ever produce enough raw material to make such a scheme viable, unless perhaps they could hook us up to Parliament House. Now there's a renewable source of BS if ever I've seen one.
