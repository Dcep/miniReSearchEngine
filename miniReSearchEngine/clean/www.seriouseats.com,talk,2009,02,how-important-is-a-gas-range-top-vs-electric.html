How important is a gas range top vs. electric?

Hail foodies!
I'm in the process of building a new home, and closing in on decision time for the kitchen...
My previous homes, all I've ever had was a gas range top so I've gotten used to taking control of the flame for granted.  This time around, natural gas is not available so I'd have to have a propane tank installed and piping run, which would total about $1200 give or take (not including the propane gas!)
Is it worth it to spend the money, or are the electric radiant ranges adequate these days? Do they give you more heat control than the old days? I'm guessing they're not good at instant-off... hehe.
I'm not a chef or anything like that , but I always like to try to do things "right" where I can.
Any advice or thoughts appreciated!
