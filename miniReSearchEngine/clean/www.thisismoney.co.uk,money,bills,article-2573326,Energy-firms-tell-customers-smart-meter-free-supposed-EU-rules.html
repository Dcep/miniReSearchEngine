Energy firms are wooing customers by promising to give them smart meters for free  even though they are supposed to do so anyway.
Smart meters give real-time information on a homes energy use and cost. Under EU rules, they will be rolled out to most households in Britain over the next six years.
Families will face higher bills to cover the introduction of the devices  but there is no upfront charge.

However, power firm First Utility is sending out emails to customers telling them they will get a smart meter for free when they sign up to one of its fixed-rate deals.

A spokesman says the email is to let its customers know they can get Smart Meters faster than with other firms, because it is at the forefront of rolling out the technology.
IS IT TIME TO SWITCH?
Energy
price tariffs are in a constant merry-go-round with suppliers 
constantly battling to pinch
customers - you - from each other.
Shrewd consumers can take advantage of 
this by doing exactly that - moving deals every six months to a year to 
ensure they are on THE cheapest deal. Even moving every other year will 
save you significant amounts.
Suppliers offer their cheapest rates via online tariffs so if you're ready to switch, it will certainly pay to do so.
If you are one of the millions of
people who have NEVER switched (i.e. stuck with your original 
supplier), then you will DEFINITELY save a big chunk of cash, possibly 
as much as 300 a year.
Prices
are different all over the country and the cheapest supplier for you 
will depend where you live. You only need to be interested in the tariff
that is going to be cheapest where you live, so do your own
comparison
to find the best price.
