Our Equal Payment Plan (EPP) offers you the convenience of making consistent monthly payments and avoiding the normal seasonal highs and lows in your electric bills.
As an EPP customer, each month you are billed one-twelfth of your annual estimated usage.Your account will be reviewed quarterly to determine if your payment amount should change to better reflect your actual usage.If the review results in a change to the EPP amount, you will get a message on your bill advising you of the new amount, which will become effective the following month. On the twelfth month of your payment plan year - your anniversary month - your amount due may be higher or lower than your usual EPP amount in order to bring your balance for the year to zero. Then your account is reviewed to ensure the appropriate payment amount for the new plan year.
There isno charge to be an EPP customer, butif you decide to return to standard billing,
contact us via our web form
or call us.

Extended Due Date
If you are at least 60 years old and receive a Social Security or pension check, or if you receive disability assistance, and your electric bill is usually due just before your monthly benefit check comes, we can extend your payment due date until after your check arrives.
Extended Payment Plan
If conditions make it difficult to pay your electric bill on time, we can arrange an extended payment plan. This maintains service while you make payments more suited to your financial situation.
Military Deferred Payment Program
1-800-962-4848
This program is designed to assist customers who are having financial difficulties because their family members have been called to active military duty. Customers participating in the program may elect to defer paying either all or part of their monthly electric bill. When the family member in the military service returns home, the account will be reviewed to determine payment arrangements for the balance owed.
Customers who have switched to an alternative generation supplier may defer the charges paid to their supplier only if that supplier offers a deferred payment program. If a supplier does not offer a deferred payment program, the supplier charges must be paid each month.

Improve ability to make a payment
Reduce consumption of electricity (eligible CAP customers must participate in WARM)
Reduce electric account debt
CAP is administered by Human Services staff members and community-based organizations. There are household income requirements and other program qualifications.
Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP)
.
LIHEAP is a federally funded grant program administered by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania through its network of local county assistance offices. LIHEAP provides customers help with paying winter heating bills, and occasionally summer cooling bills. LIHEAP funds may be used to pay an electric bill even if electricity is not the main source of heat. There are household income requirements for this program. LIHEAP has two components:
CASH
provides a cash payment directly to the utility, to be applied toward bill reduction if certain guidelines are met.
CRISIS
provides a grant to help avoid shut off of electric service, which resulted from over-due bills. This grant also can be used to restore service shut off during the winter months.

Special assistance programs - medical needs, notifications, weatherization and education
Contact us
for information about the following programs:
Critical Customer Care Program
. The Critical Customer Care Program identifies customers who use certain electrically operated life sustaining medical equipment in their home. The program helps customers - for whom a service interruption could be immediately life threatening, or would make operation of necessary medical or life supporting equipment impossible or impractical - prepare for planned and unplanned power outages. Please call us if someone in your home uses this type of medical equipment.
Medical Certification
.
Customers with severe health problems may have a licensed physician certify in writing that a termination of electric service would be especially dangerous. The medical certification will postpone the termination of electric service for 30 days. The certification is designed to provide the customer with additional time to pay their past-due balance. The customer is still responsible for the past-due amount and will be given the opportunity to pay the balance in monthly installments.
Third Party Notification
Select a third party (a friend, relative, clergy, or social service agency) to be notified, along with yourself, if your electric service is about to be disconnected. The third party is not obligated to pay overdue bills, but can remind you of pending disconnection and help you make payment arrangements.
WARM Program
1-800-207-9276
WARM is an energy conservation program forPenelec's low-income residential customers in Pennsylvania. The objective of the program is to help customers save energy and money by reducing their energy consumption. This is done by installing energy-saving home improvements in the home and by educating family members on ways to lower their electric usage. No payment is required for these installations/services.
Penelec works with community-based organizations and energy conservation contractors to provide these WARM Program services at no additional cost to eligible participants. There are household income requirements and other program qualifications.
