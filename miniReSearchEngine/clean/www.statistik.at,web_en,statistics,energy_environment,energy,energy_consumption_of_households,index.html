Overall energy consumption of households
In case of the main heating systems the trend
off coal
and
towards automated 
heating systems
continued during the last years.
Pellets wood briquettes and wood chips
are main driving forces 
therefore. Their share on the overall energy consumption increased by 
further 26% (from 10851TJ to 13713TJ) between 2009/2010 and 2011/2012. 
With a contingent of 5.0% they are significantly ahead of coal with 
0.5%. In2000 the proportion was with 1.5% against 3.5% the other way 
around. With 21.9% or 59784TJ electricity occupies the top range on 
fuel level once again.
Fuel wood
with 19.9% or
54117TJ
again the most intensively used biofuel passed
natural gas
(54068TJ) that occupies the third range just behind but clearly before
fuel oil
(
48097TJ
).
District heat
was able to increase its share from
6.9%
(2003/2004)
to 10.7%
(2011/2012) continuously while natural gas and electricity 
kept their shares.
In opposition to that,
fuel oil
lost significant market shares since 2003/2004. Its 
share declined from
24.9%
to
20.1%
(2007/2008) and at least to
17.7%
in 2011/2012. With shares clearly below
2%
coal played a minor role during the last 10years.
Taking into consideration the fuels used for space 
heating exclusively one can see a strong shift from
oil
between 2003 and 2012  its share
declined by 8.7%
from 31.7% to 23.0% - to
district heating
and
biofuels
.
District heat
increased by
5.2%
from 7.3% to 12.5% and the
biofuels
grew by
5.1%
from 27.7% to 32.8%. The share of
renewable heat
(ambient and solar heat) showed an increase 
from
1.2% to 
3.4%
while
natural gas (some 24%)
remained rather constant during this 
period
and electricity decreased by 1.2% to 3.9%.

Gas journal 2006
A
study on domestic natural gas consumption
conducted in 2006 
showed annual consumption results as follow: space heating 12.80m 
(=128.34181kWh) by square meter, water heating 127m (=1274.24193kWh) 
and cooking 11m (=108.67838kWh) by person und year.

Electricity- and gas journal  electricity 
and gas consumption as well as energy efficiency of Austrian households
The 
Electricity- and gas journal
 describes a
widespread collection of data
on the electricity- and gas consumption 
in Austria starting in2008 (time period: three to five years; current 
period: 2012). On the basis of household interviews, the
inventory of electrical appliances
and its use was surveyed. 
Furthermore the households measured their specific electricity consumption 
of relevant appliances in use. Households connected to the natural gas 
grid also reported data concerning the consumption of natural gas for 
cooking, water heating and space heating. With this data the specific
power consumption
of categories of consumption such as
space heating, water heating, lighting
or
large domestic appliances
and
entertainment electronics
was calculated.
The
report of the Electricity
- and gas journal 2012
includes the
evaluation
of the
equipment of electrical appliances
and the
electricity
- and gas consumption
based on the categories of consumption. 
Additional information on age, size and energy efficiency category of 
the existing appliances was analyzed and incorporated into the calculation 
of the specific power consumption.
Washing machines are notably younger than stoves. 
Some 37%of the washing machines are younger than 5years, in contrast 
to 22% of the stoves. The situation2008 was similar when 35% of the 
washing machines and 25% of the stoves were younger than 5years.
Tumble dryers
are clearly the
youngest category of appliances
- nearly half of them are younger 
than 5years (2008and 2012as well). Rooms are still dominated by light 
bulbs: 43% of the light fittings were light bulbs, 16% energy saving 
lamps and 10% LEDs. In2008 light bulbs dominated with still 51% and 
the proportion of energy saving lamps more than doubled from2008 to2012 
(2008: 7%; 2012: 16%)
.
An average household in 2012 consumes
4187kWh
which is 230kWh less than 2008. Substantial categories 
of consumption are electricity use for large domestic appliances 
(22.4%), space heating (14.0%) and water heating (13.8%). Like in2008
large domestic appliances
as well as
fridges
and
freezers
together consume around
30%
of the power. The 
stand
-by-consumption
 
amounts to
3.2%
of the power consumption  1% less than2008.
During the
winter period
the electricity consumption averages
14.1kWh perday
. Therefore it is about 30% higher than during 
the
summer period
with
9.8kWh
(2008: 14.4kWh in winter and 9.7kWh in summer). In winter, distinctly 
more electricity is spent on space heating lighting and drying laundry.

Modelling of electricity consumption in private 
households in Austria according to type of usage
Within this project a method for linking data records 
relating to electricity consumption in private households from different 
surveys (household energy consumption 2004, 2006, 2008 and 2010 surveys 
with the electricity and gas journal 2008) by means of statistical matching 
was developed.
In addition to information about the heating system, 
overall electricity consumption, electricity consumption for space heating, 
water heating and cooking, the model also included socio-economic criteria 
(number of individuals in the household and legal relationship to the 
dwelling), property-related criteria (age of property, living area, 
number of dwellings in the property) and regional criteria (urban versus 
rural regions).
The data records were linked for the period 2003 to 
2010 and a forecast was made for 2011. Time series were generated from 
this data for the specific uses of power in private households.
