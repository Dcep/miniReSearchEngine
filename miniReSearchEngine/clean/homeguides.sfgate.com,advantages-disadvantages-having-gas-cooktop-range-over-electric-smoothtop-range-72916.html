The Advantages & Disadvantages of Having a Gas Cooktop Range vs. an Electric Smooth-Top Range
The Advantages & Disadvantages of Having a Gas Cooktop Range vs. an Electric Smooth-Top Range
by Rochelle Leggett
A skilled cook can control the temperature with precision on a gas cooktop.
There are a number of varieties of ranges available today, both electric and gas. Electric ranges can be coil, smooth-top or induction, with the smooth-top version being particularly appealing due to ease of cleaning. Both gas ranges and electric smooth-top ranges are good choices, with plenty of appealing advantages, but both have some disadvantages, as well. If you're interested in buying a new range, you may want to know both the pluses and the minuses of gas cooktops and electric smooth-tops, and why one might be a better choice for you.
Speed
Both types of cooktops are fast, and an electric smooth-top range is notable for having even heating. However, gas cooktops are a bit faster. An electric cooktop needs to warm up, whereas the heat from a gas cooktop is immediate once you turn on the flame. When you need high heat, however, electric cooktops heat food faster and can get hotter than gas cooktops. Along with heating quickly, gas cooktops also cool down quickly, which is a safety advantage.
Cooking
When it comes to precise temperature control, gas cooktops have a clear advantage. While electric ranges cook food perfectly well, they don't have the same level of temperature control, which can be a problem if one is cooking foods that require precision and care. Temperature changes are immediate with a gas range, and some chefs can judge the temperature of a stove based on the size and appearance of the gas flames. You can use any type of cookware on a gas range without damaging the burners. However, you can't use cast-iron cookware on a smooth-top range, so your cookware options are more limited. Electric cooktops are also dependent upon being level to provide even heating, and pans with uneven or warped bottoms will cook less uniformly on an electric smooth-top, whereas this is not an issue with gas cooktops.
Installation
The difficulty of installation for gas and electric cooktops will vary depending mainly on what is already available in your kitchen. Despite the name, gas cooktops need both gas and a source of electricity. For an electric cooktop, electricity does the cooking. On a gas cooktop, it lights the gas, although you can light the burners manually using a match, which makes gas cooktops still usable in the event of a power failure, a decided advantage over electric. A gas cooktop needs to have a gas hookup available; if you don't have a gas line to your house or kitchen, you'll need to install one, which could be very costly. An electric cooktop needs a 125/250-volt outlet. Most kitchens have the proper electrical outlet, but if your kitchen was built with a gas line only, running new power lines to the range will be an additional expense. As an additional consideration with installation, it should be noted that while both types should have a ventilation hood, it is more important to have one for a gas cooktop, as the burning gas gives off some hazardous fumes, such as nitrogen dioxide, formaldehyde and carbon monoxide. If your kitchen already has a functional hood, then this is not an issue.
Cost
As far as initial cost goes, gas cooktops are a little more expensive than electric smooth-tops. However, the cost of operating a gas cooktop is noticeably less than that of an electric, so you may find that you will save enough over time to make up for the higher initial cost of a gas cooktop.
