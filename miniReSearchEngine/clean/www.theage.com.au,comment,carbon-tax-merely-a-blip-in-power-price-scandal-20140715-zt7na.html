Prime Minister Tony Abbott is right about one thing: the price of electricity has shot up and is now a lot higher than it should be. It's a scandal, in fact. Trouble is, the carbon tax has played only a small part in that, so getting rid of it won't fix the problem.
Until a rotten system is reformed, the price of electricity will keep rising excessively, so I doubt if many people will notice the blip caused by the removal of the carbon tax. (As for the price of gas, it will at least double within a year or two, as the domestic price rises to meet the international price, making the carbon tax removal almost invisible.)
So Abbott will be in bother if too many voters remember all the things he has said about how much the tax was responsible for the rising cost of living, how much damage the tax was doing to the economy and how much better everything would be once the tax was gone.
He would be wise to change the subject and join the push to reform the electricity pricing arrangements.

A
new report by
Tony Wood and Lucy Carter, of the Grattan Institute,
Fair Pricing for Power
, says that over the past five years the average Australian household's electricity bill has risen by 70 per cent to $1660 a year.
And this has been happening while the amount of electricity we use has been falling, not rising. Just why electricity demand has been falling is a story for another day.
The cost of actually generating the power accounts for 30 per cent of that total. The cost of delivering the power from the generator to your home via poles and wires that is, the electricity transmission and distribution network accounts for 43 per cent of the total.
That leaves the costs of the electricity retailer the business you deal with accounting for 13 per cent of the total bill, with the carbon tax making up 7 per cent and the various measures to encourage energy saving or use of renewables making up the last 7 per cent.
Of these various components, the one that does most to account for the rapid rise in overall bills is the cost of the physical distribution network. Whereas there's fierce competition between the now mainly privately owned power stations, the network businesses still government-owned in NSW and Queensland, but privatised in Victoria and South Australia are natural monopolies.
This means the prices the networks are allowed to charge whether government or privately owned are regulated by government authorities. And this is the source of the problem. Loopholes in the price regulation regime have made it easy for the network businesses to feather their nest at the expense of you and me.
Why would a government-owned network business want to overcharge? Because their profits are paid to the state Treasury, which needs all the cash it can get. So the NSW and Queensland governments gain by looking the other way while their voters are ripped off. The gouging hasn't been nearly as bad in privatised Victoria, where electricity prices are well below the national average.
An
earlier report from
the Grattan Institute identified four main faults in the system used to regulate the prices of network businesses: the pricing formula allows excessive rates of return, considering essential monopolies are low risk; government ownership leads to excessive investment in infrastructure and reduced efficiency; reliability standards to prevent blackouts are wastefully high; the pricing formula rewards investment in facilities you don't really need.
The various combined state and federal regulatory bodies have belatedly begun attempting to fix these problems, but they could do a lot more if the politicians prodded them harder.
Meanwhile, the latest Grattan report proposes a solution to one aspect of the over-investment problem: coping with peak demand. The trouble with electricity networks is that, if you want to avoid blackouts, the network has to be powerful enough to cope with the periods when a lot of people are using a lot of electrical appliances at the same time, which these days is a hot afternoon.
Over the course of a year, these occasions are surprisingly few, so you end up having to build a lot of capacity, which is expensive, but then is rarely used. It would make far more sense to encourage people to avoid such extreme peaks in their demand.
The way the pricing system works at present, however, is that far from discouraging people from buying airconditioners and turning them on full blast on very hot afternoons, they're subsidised by those householders who don't.
The simple answer would be for the part of people's bills that relates to their share of network costs to be changed from charging for how much power they use to a capacity-based charge. That is, they pay according to the maximum load they put on the network in peak periods.
The result would be to remove the subsidy between high and low-capacity users, increasing or reducing their bills by up to $150 a year.
The greater benefit would be the price signal sent to high-capacity users to reduce their use of appliances during peak periods and save. As people responded to this incentive, the need to keep adding to the network's capacity would fall, thus reducing the need for higher electricity prices.

Let's just say the carbon tax was contributing 7% to the overall electricity bill and you find that minimal is that an admission that it's ineffective in achieving it's goals? Where would the incentive be for industry to switch to renewable energy if it was making minimal difference to the bottom line? Can't have it both ways Ross. The carbon tax is an awful policy whether left or right, it's half baked tokenism and we should be thankful it's to be dead and buried this week.

Abolishing the carbon tax or ETS will have a minimal affect on prices but it will increase the government deficit and harm Australia's reputation. The Direct Action plan is much worse since it will not be as effective in reducing carbon pollution but cost about the same. Doing nothing at all will encourage other countries to do the same leading to poor outcomes as predicted by the climate experts as opposed by the propagandists.

hi Piped Piper -
Let's say that someone installed newer, more efficient turbines and dropped their carbon per kw hour by 50%, they would halve that cost and perhaps sell at 3% less than their competitors.  (Ok, make it 2% to cover the costs of retooling).  That gets them greater market share and forces their competitors to improve their performance to compete.
But your premise is wrong.  There was a substantial drop in carbon emissions from power producers in the weeks after the tax was introduced, so the tax works.
Abbott got the Carbon Tax completely wrong.  He doesn't understand Market Forces 101.

I've always wondered that too.
"The carbon tax will give a price signal to people to reduce demand"
vs
"The carbon tax barely makes a dent in prices - it's just a Liberal scare campaign!"

This article is not about the carbon tax but it points out that 43% of the cost of electricity is down to the behaviour of the distributors - "gold plating the network" as it's been called by some. Nobody said that 7% cost from the carbon tax or 7% from renewable energy targets was ineffectual but the LNP were quite happy to let everyone believe that all their pain was due to the carbon tax and clearly that just isn't true.

So the coalition ditches the carbon tax, which was some assistance in making polluters pay for the damage we cause to the environment.  But what are they replacing it with, a vague direct action policy, much of which seems cloud cuckoo land stuff about snatching carbon from the smoke stacks and burying it.  The Liberal manifesto spruiks about the 15,000 strong green army, are these green people coming from Mars?   The usual ostrich approach from the Abbott Government, just stick your head in the sand and hope it will all go away.

You certainly can have it both ways. You are assuming the cost to the consumer is the same as the cost to the supplier. Also, you are not taking into account the compensation the consumer received.

The carbon tax axing has been transformed into a gift to the energy businesses. Any refund to customers will be lost in the cheering, and Clive's input will prove shambolic. The policy had a purpose, now it's just extra profit margin. Tony Abbott said on the day that he last federal election was called that he would not lead a government that deals with minor parties and independents! So to remove this policy, what has Abbott done - lie, again.

There's an elephant charging at us (the poles and wires rort) and a badger charging at us (the carbon tax). Tony Abbott only had one bullet and this week he used it to shoot the badger.

Let's say it's less than 7% and let's say that it opens and promotes employment and investment opportunities in new industries and technologies that appear to be emerging quickly all over the world.
Don't count on your financial planner backing this one - old school gives bigger kick backs.
And the privatization model that leaps to mind is Sydney airport. How can this ever work for the consumer in a monopoly/oligopoly scenario.
