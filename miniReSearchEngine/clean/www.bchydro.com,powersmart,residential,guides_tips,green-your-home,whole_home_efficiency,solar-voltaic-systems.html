Solar PV systems at home
Learn about the affordability, cost savings and environmental impacts to consider when installing solar panels to generate electricity at home.
How solarPhotovoltaic (PV) systems work
Solar PV systems are comprised mainly of solar panels, inverters, breakers and mounting equipment.
A solar PVpanel generates power by converting sunlight to direct current (DC) electricity. Inverters are then used to convert the DC power to AC power for your home use.
There are two main types of Solar PV systems:
Grid-tied systems, which feed AC power directly to the local grid
Off-grid systems, which store DC power in batteries for later use
Its important to note that any grid-tied systems require complex electrical connections and must be approved by BC Hydro before installation to ensure safety and effective operation.
Learn about BC Hydro's net metering program
, which is designed for residential and  commercial customers who wish to connect a small electricity generating  unit to the BC Hydro distribution system.

Affordability
The cost of installing solar PV systems has declined steadily over the last decade as a result of technology improvements and more efficient systems yielding a higher power output.
In B.C., a 1 kW solar PV system, south facing and tilted with no shading, will generate about 1,200 kWh per year or about 30,000 kWh over its 25 year lifetime. This is taking into account an industry average solar panel efficiency degradation rate of 0.5% per year.
At a turnkey installation cost of about $3,000, it would take you over 25 years to recoup your investment at todays average electricity rates.
In remote locations where there is no grid to tie into for power, off-grid solar PV systems can be used to store power in batteries which can be used throughout the day or even at night. In B.C., off-grid systems make for a sound investment when installed in locations where alternative power sources such as diesel generators are required.
Batteries are obviously an added cost to an off-grid system and, depending on the type of batteries used, they require regular maintenance and/or replacement during the systems lifecycle.
Cost savings
Since sunlight is free, the cost of producing power for a domestic solar PV system is limited to the cost of maintenance, which is relatively low. Solar PV panels typically do not need to be replaced unless physically damaged or malfunctioning. Panels only require cleaning about twice a year, to clear any debris.
To achieve real savings with a solar PV system in todays market, speak with a professional systems designer to help you understand the potential to produce reliable solar power at your site location.
Health & comfort
Solar PV systems are static and silent systems that can generate clean energy for your home use. They can be installed on your homes rooftop with minimal building impact and are virtually hidden from sight.
Environmental considerations
Solar panels are made mostly of glass and aluminum, which can be mostly recovered and reused, either in new PV panels or other products. Some solar PV manufacturers will take back old or damaged panels for recycling.
Batteries for off-grid systems can have a negative impact on the environment if not disposed of or recycled properly. There are designated recycling depots for batteries to ensure minimal environmental impact.
Other considerations
Before installing a solar system on your homes roof, consider your roofs current condition and if rework is needed anytime in the near future.
Solar PV panels require little maintenance and only need to be cleaned at least twice a year to ensure the panel is absorbing maximum sunlight at all times. Dirt, dust, bird droppings and snow can drastically affect the output of each solar panel.
Mounting solar PV panels can be complicated. They need to be mounted in a specific orientation and in an area with clear sunlight and no shadows to ensure optimal performance.
Be aware of nearby objects or buildings that can potentially cast a shadow on the solar panels at some point throughout the day. A professional systems designer can simulate a model for your specific location to estimate annual yield and losses due to shading.
Off-grid solar PV systems
Off-grid systems are more expensive due to the added costs of the battery banks and charge controllers.
Battery banks are one of the highest lifecycle costs of an off-grid solar PV system as they require regular maintenance and/or replacement to ensure optimum system performance and longevity.
Certain battery types such as absorbed glass mat (AGM) require no maintenance and are well suited for solar PV systems.
Depending on the type used, batteries have a life span of anywhere from 5 to 10 years. Speak with a professional to understand your battery options for your specific application.
Off-grid systems need to be sized appropriately to ensure that the battery banks are being used at its maximum capacity throughout the year.
Consider hybrid solar PV/diesel generator systems for remote locations to ensure an adequately sized solar PV system and reliable power even during long periods of cloudy weather conditions.
FAQ
Can I install a solar PV system myself?
Installing a solar PV system can be complicated, especially for roof mounted systems. Solar panels are essentially made of glass and need to be handled with care. Mounting solar panels on your roof should be done by a roof system professional to ensure that no damage is done to the buildings existing weather proofing during installation.
For optimum performance, the solar panels must be installed in a specific orientation and location taking many other factors into account to ensure safety and maximum power output.
Connecting a solar PV system to the grid requires complex electrical connections which need to be approved by BC Hydro. We recommend hiring a professional solar PV system installer to ensure that all necessary permits are obtained and that all safety measures are in place before the system is energized.
Can a solar PV system generate power on cloudy or rainy days?
As long as there is natural day light, a solar PV system will continue to generate power even on cloudy and rainy days. However, a solar PV system will not generate its peak power unless under direct, unobstructed sun light.
How much space do I need to install a solar PV system?
A solar PV array size depends on site conditions and location. Locations with less than optimal conditions require a larger solar array than sites with optimal conditions, taking into account geographic location and orientation, as well as shading conditions. In B.C., a 1kW solar PV array would require about 7  8 square metres of south facing free space. A professional systems installer can help you estimate the solar potential of your home.
