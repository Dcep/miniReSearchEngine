How much electricity does my refrigerator use?
Last update: April, 2014
Refrigerators are a bigchunk of home energy use
In most homes the refrigerator is thesecond-largest user of electricity (13.7%), rightafter the air conditioner (14.1%).
(
Dept.
of Energy
)
With
most appliances you save energy by using them less,but you can't very well do that with yourfridge. The main way to save money with yourfridge is to use an efficient model. Newfridges aren't just a little more efficient, they're
incredibly
more efficient. A 1986-era18 c.f. fridge uses
1400 kWh
a year, while amodern energy-efficient model uses only
350 kWh
 a whopping 75% reduction. At 15 kWh,trading in a pre-1986 fridge for a new efficient onewould save about $158 a year in electricitycosts. And some older fridges are even worsethan the average.
One
reader
estimates her savings to be
$238per year
for trading in her 1979 fridge for a2004 model.
One big caveat:
All the figures onthis page are with any ice maker turned OFF.When the icemaker is on then usage could be as muchas
double
.
(
Consumer
Reports
, 2008)
If you trade inan old fridge without an icemaker for anicemaker-equipped fridge, and you run the icemaker,you might not see any savings.
Should you replaceyour current fridge?
If your fridge was made before 2001, then yes,you should almost certainly trade it in.
Older fridges are
wildly
ineffecient.The best modern models use less than
half
ofwhat 1993-2000 fridges used. For older fridgesit's even more striking: Replacing a 1992fridge with a modern Energy Star model could save
$1400
in electricity costs
over the useful life ofthe fridge.
So if you've got an oldfridge, yes, trade it in.
You might evenbe able to get a
state
rebate
for buying an energy-efficientfridge. Your city or utility might have arebate program, too. (Check with them.)

If your fridge was made 2001 or later, it's atougher call.
As you can see from thetable, trading in a 2001+ model for a new EnergyStar model might save around $20/yr. in energycosts, or $280 over its useful life. That'scertainly not as much as it would cost you to buy anew fridge. On the other hand, you're going tohave to replace your fridge sooner or later anyway,since the average useful life is only around 14years. So the question isn't really, "Should Ireplace my fridge?", but rather, "Should I replaceit
early
(before it
needs
replacing)?" To answer that question, use thecalculator above, not the table, because thecalculator will let you choose your fridge size andlocal electricity rate, which isall-important. As I always say, the figuresprovided in the table are
samples
.
Your
savings
will differ
depending on howmuch you're paying for electricity and the size ofthe fridge. (It'll also differ by the exactmodel you buy, and how warm or cool your kitchen is,by the way.)
One reason to replace the fridge now is that savingenergy reduces pollution. I always pay alittle more if it means I pollute a littleless. I traded in my old fridge before it diedfor that very reason.
Help in choosing a newfridge
Get an EnergyStarmodel.
In the U.S., look forthe
Energy
Star
label, which identifies fridges that areat least 20% more efficient than standard models.
(
EPA
;see
Sources
for older standards)
(Don'tconfuse this with the
EnergyGuide
label thatall appliances get.)  At 15/kWh, a 25 c.f.EnergyStar fridge will save about an extra $23/yearvs. standard models, or $322 over its life.That will more than pay for the extra cost of anEnergy Star model, which is only $38 for a ~22cu.ft. model on Sears.com today (6/1/10).
CEE Tier 3.
While Energy Star fridges use 20% less energythan standard models, CEE Tier 3 (CT3) fridges use30% less.
(
source
,PDF)
That's great for those who wantto be as efficient as possible, but at 15/kWh, thatextra 10% amounts to only $9/year savings over anEnergy Star fridge. That's because Energy Starfridges are already very efficient. The$9/year works out to $126 over the fridge's usefullife, which is almost exactly the $120 extra thatthe CT3 model costs (according my price check in6/10 on Sears.com). So it might not save youany money, but since the savings can pay for itself,it doesn't hurt to go with a CT3 model. And ofcourse, if your local electric rate is higher than Iused in my example, you'll actually see moresavings. The only problem in shopping for aCT3 fridge is that they're usually not labeled asCT3. You'll have to download the
CT3
fridge list
for reference when you go shopping
For a smaller fridge(18-22cf), get a Top-Freezer model.
Refrigerators with the freezer on top use the leastenergy. Side-by-Side models use 13% more juicethan top-freezer models, according to my analysis ofthe Energy Star fridges list from May 2010.However, as of 2007, top freezer models aren'tavailable in larger sizes (>22cf), so atop-freezer is an option only if you're going with asmaller unit. Almost all the bigger fridgesbeing made these days are side-by-side.
(
EPA
,194k PDF)
(Interestingly,bottom-freezer models are about the same efficiencyas top-freezers, even though you'd suspect thatbottom-freezer models would have an advantage sincehot air rises. Also, the penalty forside-by-side models used to be even higher. AnAugust 2002 Consumer Reports article showed that2002-era side-by-side models used a whopping 45%more energy than top-freezer models.)
Skip the ice maker anddispenser.
Theseratchet up the energy use quite a bit.According to the EPA these features mean 14-20% inextra energy, but Consumer Reports testing showedthat these features could
double
energy use.

Super-EfficientFridges.
Sun
Frost
makes super-efficient fridges, includinga 16 cubic foot model that uses only 372 kWh a year.(They're marketed towards people who are poweringtheir homes with solar electricity, where every wattcounts.) A new Japanese model called
CoolView
claims to reduce costs by up to 55%.
Also, you can
make
your
own super-efficient fridge
by converting achest freezer. It uses a mere 0.1 kWh a day,or 36.5 kWh a year! Chest freezers are moreefficient than fridges because they have moreinsulation and because the cold air doesn't spillout when you open the door, because cold air fallsdown, not up. There are a couple of obviousdownsides. First is that it might not be as easy foryou to access your food in a chest freezer. Anotheris that the new fridge will take up more floorspace. Finally, you'll need a separate freezer. Butif these things don't put you off, then you can savequite a bit of energy. Read Tom's instructions for
how
to make a super-efficient fridge
.
Old manual defrost fridgeswon't save money.
You might have heard that manual defrostfridges use less energy than frost-free, so youmight be tempted to look for an old manual defrostmodel.
Don't.
Old fridges useway more energy than new ones, even if the old oneis manual defrost. I once had an oldmanual-defrost model that used 1000 kWh year, whichis more than twice what a modern 425 kWh EnergyStar,
frost-free
model uses. Now, a
modern
manual-defrost fridge could be an energy-saver, butI haven't been able to find one that's energyefficient. The only modern frost-free model Iknow of is the
Vestfrost
,but it uses 548 kWh  more than a standard fridge.
Saving energy with yourexisting fridge
Turn off the anti-sweat feature.
Many fridges have small heaters that keepmoisture from forming on the cabinet. This uses anextra 5-10% extra electricity. Most models that havethis feature have a switch that lets you turn itoff, usually labeled "Energy Saver".
(
source)
Set the temperature foronly as cold as you need it.
Fridge should be 36-40F, and the freezershould be 0-5F (-17 to -10C). Fridges set 10degrees lower than needed (or freezers set 5 degreeslower than needed) can increase energy use by asmuch as 20-25%. Personally, I set my ownfridge to 56 because as a
vegan
I never store super-perishables like meat or dairy.
To test the fridge temperature, put a thermometerin a glass of water in the center of the fridgeand leave it there for 24 hours. To test thefreezer temperature, put the thermometer betweentwo frozen packages. If the temperature is colderthan needed, then set the fridge to a warmertemperature.
Don't put hot foods inthe fridge.
Food safety experts say you shouldrefrigerate hot food to prevent contamination. Butthat doesn't mean you have to refrigerate themimmediately. The
USDA
says to refrigerate within two hours of preparation(or one hour if the room temp is above 90). One totwo hours of cooling off time will definitely makeyour refrigerator work less. It's a tradeoff-- the sooner you refrigerate the safer the food,but the more energy you'll use. Of course,meat and dairy foods are most susceptible tocontamination, which is yet another reason to noteat meat and dairy in the first place.
Yosh Hash sent in the tip that you can greatlycool items by putting them in a container andsoaking them in a pot of cold water for 15-30minutes, which reduces the amount of heat thefridge will have to remove once you stick them inthe fridge.
Along the same lines, he writes: "A lot of peopledo not seem to understand that the middle positionon a faucet means half cold, half hot. I'veseen people fill a pitcher with lukewarm water andput it in the fridge! What a waste -- theypaid to heat the water, then they pay to take thatheat right back out of the water. Please tell yourreaders when when they're refrigerating water,they should draw cold water into the pitcher, notwarm." Consider your wish granted.
Thaw frozen foods in thefridge rather than on the counter.
They'll help cool the fridge as theydefrost.
Pick a good spot for thefridge.
Your fridge will use less energy if youkeep it away from heat and also place it where theheat it generates can easily dissipate.Position your fridge out of direct sunlight, andaway from heat sources such as the oven and heatregisters. Help the fridge get rid of the heat itgenerates by placing it along an external wall. Ifyou don't use air conditioning then put the fridgein front of an open window to let the heat easilyescape. This doesn't just make your fridge workless, it keeps your house cooler too. If yourchoices for locating your fridge are limited then atthe very least make sure there as at least 2" ofspace all around to allow for circulation.
More on temperature & energy use:
ASun Frost fridge uses
61%
more energy
in a 90-degree F environmentthan a 70-degree environment. Home Energy magazinehas a chart showing
refrigerator
energy
use per degree of temperature
. But thisdoesn't mean you should keep your house extra coolso that the fridge uses less energy, becauseyou'll use way more energy to cool your home thanyou'll save be having your fridge work less. Airconditioning uses way more electricity thanfridges. Instead, just put your fridge in a goodlocation, as explained above.
Door Openings.
Home
Energy
magazine
says door openings account for 7% offridge energy use, assuming 42 door openings aday. But the Institute of Food &Agricultural Sciences at the University of Florida
(link
no longer available)
says poor open/closehabits waste 50 to 120kWh a year, which would be10-24% of a 500 kWh/yr. fridge. They don't saywhether this is too-frequent opening, or leavingopen too long when opening, or both.
I'mopenly calling on readers to test how muchdoor-openings matter, using a
Kill-A-Watt
meter
, keeping track of how manytimes and for how long you open the door, comparedto a 24- or 48-hour period where you don't openthe door at all.
Report your findingsand I'll share them with everyone on this page.
Defrost a non-frost-freefreezer before the frost exceeds a quarter-inchthick.
More frost makes the freezer work harder.But better yet, if your fridge isn't frost-free,that means it's old, and old fridges use tons ofenergy. Replace it with a newer model, made in 2001or later.
Cleaning the coils helpsa little, but not much.
Just about every other Saving Energy guideout there tells you that cleaning the coils on yourfridge is important to saving energy. They'reguessing. Cleaning a set of very dirty coilswill save maybe 5%, or less than $5 a year on apost-2000 era fridge.
(
source
)
One reader, Steve, measured the energy use of hisold 1995, 24 c.f. fridge for about 100 hours eachbefore and after cleaning the coils. He got a6.5% reduction in energy, which will save him $8.30a year at 15/kWh.
Of course, it can't
hurt
to clean them,so here's how to clean the coils: The coilsare the small, winding black pipe either on theback of the fridge, or the slotted vents on thebottom. If you can reach the coils easilywith a brush and/or vacuum then use that. Ifthey're hard to get to, then you can do what Stevedid and move the fridge to the yard and then blastthe coils with a leaf blower.
Use a transparent plasticcurtain
You may have seen these in the perishablessection of a grocery store -- vertical transparentplastic strips. They keep the cold in whilestill allowing you to see what's behind them.You can do the same thing for your fridge by cuttingup a transparent plastic shower curtain and tapingit to the ceiling of the fridge compartment.If you do this, I recommend one of the newer EVAcurtains (such as
this
one
form Bed Bath & Beyond), rather thanthe more common PVC curtains, which are smelly andmuch more toxic and definitely something you don'twant around food.
Make sure the gasket isin good shape.
The gasket is that piece of rubber goingaround the door that seals the door to therefrigerator. If it doesn't seal well, thencold air is escaping so your fridge is working a lotharder. If parts of it are coming off, thenre-attach it with some adhesive caulk.
Turn the fridge OFF?!
Elizabeth Stone writes:
"I
was
inspired this month to unplug my refrigerator andcool just with ice that I can make outdoors. I cankeep the refrigerator at 45 degrees for about fivedays with a couple of big pot fulls of ice. It hadoccurred to me how wasteful it was to be coolingsomething in the winter in a northern climate! Ittakes more attention and effort than just having aplugged-in refrigerator, but perhaps there areothers out there that might also try this if theywere given the idea."
At first I thought this was a good idea, but itactually doesn't work, because while your fridgeworks a little less by importing ice, your heaterhas to work a little more. Here's how thatworks:There's X amount of heat in yourhome in the winter. As heat slowly escapesyour home through walls and windows, your heaterkicks in and heats the house up again. Nowyou bring in a big block of ice. No matterwhere you put it, that effectively extracts heatfrom your home, since the ice will absorbit. Granted, it will take longer for that tohappen when the ice is in the sealed fridge ratherthan on your living room floor, but it'll stillhappen over time, and that brings us to the nextpoint: Before you put extra ice in thefridge, the exhaust from the fridge was helping toheat the house, so your heater could run a littleless. But once you add the ice to the fridgeand turn it off, the fridge is no longer helpingwith the house heat. So you save on theenergy to run the fridge, but you use a littlemore energy to heat the house. Yes, it's not
much
more energy to heat the house, butneither is it much energy saved in the fridge withthe ice, either. In theory there's somefinancial savings if your local rate forelectricity for the fridge is a lot higher thanyour local rate for whatever fuel you use to heatthe house with, but even in that case the savingswould be so small as to be negligible.
One reader asked if you could just make ice withthe icemaker to cool the fridge? You could,but it won't save any energy, because it takesenergy to make the ice with the icemaker.
Now, keeping some ice in the fridge can also helpkeep your food cool if the power goes out, butit's not an energy-saving technique.

for 41,000 differentrefrigerator models from 1979 to 1992.
