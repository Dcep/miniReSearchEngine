Sun Frost Refrigerators are Made in U.S.A.!
For power outages, we can equip your Sun Frost
          refrigerator with a non-interruptible power supply!
Sun 
        Frost refrigerators and freezers are so outstandingly energy-efficient, 
        powering a home with solar power or other low output energy sources 
        is both feasible and affordable. All models are available in 12, 24, or 48 volt DC, or 110, 220 volt AC. Even in a home using conventional 
        utility power, energy consumption for refrigeration is typically 
        cut by a factor of five!

Sun 
          Frost participates in the U.S. government ENERGY STAR program, 
          and several of our models bear the ENERGY STAR label. Visit the 
          ENERGY STAR web site at

In addition to unrivaled energy efficiency, Sun 
          Frost offers amenities not found in conventional refrigerators, 
          such as high humidity, food-saving storage, ultra-quiet operation 
          and an easy-to-clean interior.
Every 
          Sun Frost is custom crafted - you choose the hinge side and finish. 
          Your Sun Frost can be finished with a number of laminate or wood 
          finishes. We are now also offering a stainless steel option. Ask 
          us!

Efficiency
          - Plus
The Sun Frost refrigerator employs an array of important innovations to achieve its exceptionally low energy consumption. The cooling system on the Sun Frost is top mounted. This reduces energy consumption several ways. The heat generated by the compressor and condenser (black coils on the back of many refrigerators) does not reenter the refrigerator, and with a cooler-running condenser the efficiency of the cooling system is increased.
Made in the USA
Quiet Operation
The condensers on Sun Frost refrigerators and freezers are cooled
          passively, except our RF19 and F19 models, which use a quiet
          and highly efficient fan to help cool the condenser. Because
          of the efficient design of the Sun Frost, the compressors used
          run less often, are much smaller and produce correspondingly
          less noise than those found on a conventional refrigerator.
          These features make the Sun Frost much quieter than a conventional
          AC refrigerator.
Simple
          Defrost System
Defrosting a Sun Frost is a simple process. Frost build-up in the
          Sun Frost freezer is very slow because there is no air circulating
          between the freezer and refrigerator sections. The ice that forms
          in the freezer collects primarily on the ceiling. When defrosting
          the freezer section, the contents of the freezer may be transferred
          to the refrigerator section so they remain frozen. After the refrigerator
          has been turned off for about twenty minutes, the ice is easily
          removed in large pieces. There is no mop-up because the ice does
          not need to be melted, only separated from the flat ceiling.
Superior Storage Conditions
Sun Frost refrigerators keep food fresher by maintaining high humidity. This prevents freezer burn and wilting caused by water loss. In a SUN FROST, foods often last two to three times longer than in conventional refrigerators.
          In typical refrigerators, the water contained in food is transformed into ice on the freezer's cooling coils. This process results in the dehydration of fruits and vegetables, increases energy consumption, and accelerates frost buildup. In a conventional refrigerator, high humidity is achieved by storing food in airtight containers, which creates high humidity conditions, but cuts off the foods' oxygen supply. Without oxygen, plant cells break down anaerobically, decreasing shelf life. The Sun Frost allows you to store produce in breathable containers, which considerably lengthens its shelf life.
Fewer
          Solar Panels
The SUN FROST RF16 typically consumes 15 KWH per month. By contrast, the average refrigerator in a home consumes 75 KWH per month.
          Producing the 75 KWH needed to run this refrigerator in an off-grid solar power system would require an initial investment of at least $4,500 in hardware. The SUN FROST would require a $500 investment.
Reliable
The cooling system of the Sun Frost refrigerator contains a minimal
          number of moving parts. Both the DC and AC compressors incorporate
          highly reliable, hermetically sealed, brushless motors. The efficient
          thermal design of Sun Frost refrigerators also contributes to
          their reliability. The top-mounted cooling system runs at a lower
          temperature than most, which prolongs the life of the system's
          lubricants and reduces mechanical strain on the compressor. The cooling system has proved itself to typically provide over twenty-five years of trouble free operation.
Cooler
          Summer Kitchen
During the summer, a typical refrigerator adds as much heat to
          your kitchen as a 1000 watt heater running four hours per day!
          The energy needed by your air conditioner to remove this excess
          heat will be about half the energy consumed by your refrigerator.
