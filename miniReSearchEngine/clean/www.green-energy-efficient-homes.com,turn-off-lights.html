Turn off lights when youre not using them
Has anyone ever told you that you shouldnt turn off lights if youll need to turn them on again within a few minutes? That it takes more energy to turn the light back on than to leave it on?
I dont know where this idea came from, but it just isnt true. Whats the theory behind it? People think theres a power surge when you turn on a light, and that this surge uses as much as fifteen minutes of what the bulb normally uses. So the misguided assumption is that its better to leave lights on than to turn off lights youll be needing in the near future.
To understand how this is a fallacy, lets consider the lowly (and soon to be obsolete) incandescent light. A bright incandescent bulb burns 100 watts. Lets assume we turn the light on, then off, then on again, at intervals one second apart. That means that every other second, we would be using the equivalent of five minutes of what that 100 watt bulb uses.
That 100 watt bulb uses 100 watts per second (110 watt-seconds) each second it is on. So if it were to burn five minutes worth of extra electricity each time it is switched on, it would burn 100 watts, times 5 minutes, times 60 seconds, in other words 30,000 watt-seconds, during the second when it was switched on. Since those 30,000 watt-seconds are all being burned in a single second, we cancel out the seconds and get the theoretical equivalent of 30,000 watts of power. And since watts = amps X volts, and we know volts is either 120 or 240 (more or less), that would mean the circuit the bulb is running on would be 250 or 125 amps, respectively. Since most household circuit breakers are in the 5-15 amp range, we can see that if this fallacy were in fact true, people would be blowing their circuit breakers every time they switched on a light! QED.
If I turn off lights too often, will they wear out
Screw-in sensor

All right you say, but wont you wear bulbs out if you turn off lights too often?
Yes,you will wear a bulb out sooner. All you have to do is watch a 5-year-old switch a light on and off five times a second for a few minutes, then watch the bulb burn out, to realize that frequent on-and-off action for a light bulb does indeed wear it out. But we are not talking about rapid on-and-off cycling. We are talking about a cycle that lasts a minute, five, or fifteen minutes or more.
You might like to know how much of a bulbs life hours are used up each time it is turned on and off. Sorry I cant tell you  havent been able to find a reliable answer to this. (There are plenty of places where its recommended you switch the lights off if youre going to be gone more than 15 minutes, but no data to back this up.)
What I can tell you is this: even if it turns out that you shorten a bulbs life by one hour each time you turn off lights, youll still save both energy and money if you turn off lights whenever you leave a room, even if you plan to come back a minute later.
Turning off incandescent lights
Lets look at the lowly incandescent again. I can buy one for about 25 cents. They last for about 1,000 hours and they burn 0.1 kilowatt hours (kwh) for each hour they are left on. Lets assume each incandescent has 1,000 on-and-off cycles before it burns out, and lets assume electricity costs us $0.10 per kwh, which means it costs 1 cent to run that 100 watt bulb for one hour:
Every time you turn a bulb off you are using 1/1000 of the $0.25 you paid for the bulb, or 0.05 of a cent
Every time you turn a bulb off for 5 minutes you are saving 1/12 of $0.01, or 0.16 of a cent
So you are actually saving more than three times as much by turning the light off for five minutes, as you would by trying to extend the bulb life by leaving it on. And my assumption about it using one hour worth of the bulbs light to turn it on and off again just isnt true  it was just to prove a point.
An incandescent bulb converts about 90% of its energy to heat. So when youre trying to keep the house cool, turning it off will also help save on cooling costs.
And dont forget that by leaving the light on, youve also removed another five minutes from the life of the bulb, since the bulb was running during that time.
Turning out LED house lights
As for turning off
LED house lights
, we dont need to do the calculation  because there actually is no extra wear and tear on an LED light bulb from turning it on and off.
And dont be lulled into complacency by the low power consumption of LED house lights. While a replacement for a 100 watt incandescent bulb might only use 5 watts, if you forget youve left it on, youll still be wasting electricity. Not as much as with a 100-watt bulb, but theres no point in spending money on more energy efficient technology and then abandoning your energy saving ways!
Turning out compact fluorescent lights

Lets apply the same logic we applied to an incandescent bulb, to a CFL. For a compact fluorescent, turning the light off does actually cause a bit of wear and tear on the bulb. But the bulb lasts about eight times longer than an incandescent bulb. Lets assume the same 1 hour shortening of the bulbs life when you turn the light off. A typical CFL has a life of about 8,000 hour life. A CFL of 23 watts, available on the web for $3.95, emits about the same amount of light as a 100 watt incandescent bulb. For electricity at $0.10 per kwh, it costs you 0.23 cents ($0.0023) to run that bulb for one hour.
Every time you turn a CFL off you are using 1/8000 of the $3.95 you paid for the bulb, or 0.05 of a cent
Every time you turn a CFL off for 5 minutes you are saving 1/12 of $0.0023, or 0.02 of a cent
Here, the economics of leaving the light on if youre gone for less than five minutes seems to make more sense. Except for one thing: the one hour life shortening is made up. We just dont know how much of a bulbs life is eaten up by switching it on once. (At least, I dont know, and Ive looked around a fair bit!)
And except for one other thing: distraction!
Distractions when you
dont
turn off lights?
If you make it a habit to turn off lights whenever you no longer need them, theyll stay off until you come back. You might think youre coming back in two minutes, or five or fifteen. But what if something comes up? What if a long phone call, a visit from a neighbor, or a quick run to the grocery store keeps you away longer than the five minutes you planned?
And what if you just plain forget about the light you left on? Then the five minutes can become five hours (for a bedroom or bathroom light, for example), or even five days for a light in a room you rarely visit such as the furnace room.
Using motion or infrared sensors
Leviton infrared occupancy sensor light switch, manual on, auto off
About $41
If you just cant remembering to turn off lights when you leave a room, you might consider installing a motion sensor plug (for a floor or table lamp) or a motion sensor light switch or ceiling light adapter. These devices work as follows:
You can turn on the light from the switch, or have it go on when motion or the heat of a human body is detected.
A Manual-On device is only activated when you flick the switch; a Sensor-On device can also be activated by motion or heat.
A few minutes after the device stops detecting movement or body heat, the power to the light is shut off.
The sensors in these devices do consume a small amount of power, but far less than youll consume if you keep forgetting to turn off lights!
See the motion or infrared sensor light bulb connections, switches, and plug-in devices featured on this page  they are all available through Amazon.com.
Retrofitting existing switches
Lights Out Auto Switch
About $20
For those who want a motion sensor light switch but arent electrically inclined, you can install a special sensor panel over top of a standard light switch that will turn the switch off after a set period of inactivity.
This switch mounts easily with just a screw driver. It requires three AA batteries, and can be set to turn off after 1, 5, 15, or 30 minutes of inactivity. Once youve set it up, it monitors motion in the room, and shuts the light switch off when theres been no motion during the timer period.
This is a great way to save money if someone in your house is prone to forgetting to turn off a light, especially one thats in an out-of-the-way room where the light might otherwise get left on for hours at a time.
Turn off lights  make it your philosophy
Make it your philosophy to turn off lights. Not only will you save electricity when you turn off lights, and save money overall, but it will remind you to be an energy saver in other ways. And youll be setting a visible example to others, who will become more conservation conscious as well.
Once youve gotten into the habit of turning off lights (and convinced others in your household to do the same) dont forget to put some of the savings into adding more energy saving lightbulbs to your home  CFLs, dimmable CFLs, LEDs, fluorescent tube lighting.
