How much electricity do household items use?
Last update:
June 2013
The calculator at right will give you a rough idea of howmuch electricity something uses and how much it costs you.
But
there are some important caveats:
Electricity rates vary
widely
.
I'vefound rates from 12 to 50 per kWh from the
sameprovider
. If you want results that are anywhereclose to accurate, you'll need to check your own electricbill and find your actual kWh rate. Your bill mighthave multiple kWh rates (e.g., one for "delivery" and onefor "fuel"), and in that case you should to add up them allup to get the total kWh rate. Most rates are
tiered
,meaning the higher your use, the higher the rate. Youshould generally enter your highest tier into thecalculator, because any energy you save will save you moneyat that highest tiered rate.
Electrical use varies from model to model.
Ithought this would be obvious, but in hundreds of blogs andforums people say things like, "Mr. Electricity says acomputer uses 150 watts," which is amischaracterization. The calculator and table figuresare just
examples.
(See
how
to
misquote this website
.)
Some devices use
varying
amounts ofelectricity.
An easy example is an oven, whoseenergy use depends on how high you crank it. Perhaps aless obvious example is a washing machine, which effectivelyuses
phenomenally more energy
ifyou wash in hot rather than cold. Then there's the
refrigerator
,which alternates between periods of full energy use whilethe compressor is running, and then next to nothing when thecompressor shuts off. (To solve this problem forfridges, the calculator lists the average wattage over time,not the higher amount used when the compressor runs.)
Most devices don't run 24/7.
Therefore the"Hours per Day" and "Days per Month" fields in thecalculator are crucial. Even so, you might not have agood idea about how various appliances run. So belowwe'll discuss which items use the most energy in a typicalhome. You can also
measure adevice's usage yourself
, which gives you the bestinformation for your own situation.

The chart at right shows how the average home used energy(not just electricity) in 2007.

Of course, heating is a biggerchunk in the winter and air conditioning is a bigger chunk inthe summer. For example, AC accounts for 60-70% of the averagehome's summertime power bill in Austin.
(

Places which aren't as hot insummer don't get a break, because they're generally colder inwinter and so more is spent on heating. Below at right isthe energy use for an all-electric home in Tallahassee, Florida,which shows that 60% of the energy goes to heating and cooling.

Note
that this doesn't really jibe with the pie chart above fromthe DoE. (Refrigerators and appliances use differentamounts in the different charts.) If I can ever find thetime, I'll try to make my own chart.
Here are some other websites that give sample costs forvarious household items considering how much those items areused:

At far right is a table listing

of thewattage of common household appliances.
Appliances that create or remove heat use the mostelectricity.
In the table at right, appliancesthat make things hot are
listed inred
and ones that make things cold are
listed
in blue
. As you can see, together they dwarfeverything else on the list.

.)
Figuring the use of yourown items
The best way to know how much energy your stuff uses is tomeasure it.
You can do that easily with a cheapwatt-hour meter, or you can do it for free by timing yourelectric meter. I explain all this on the page about
measuring
your
electrical use
.
A shortcut, though a little less accurate, is to just look atthe product's label.
Nearly everything youcan plug into the wall has a label that says how muchelectricity it uses. (It may be printed directly into theplastic or metal.) You may have to hunt for thelabel. It's often located on the bottom or side of thedevice, or possibly where the power cord enters the unit.If the device is powered with an AC/DC adapter, the electricalrating is usually listed on the adapter itself.
If the label gives only the number of amps and not thenumber of watts,
then just multiply the amps by 120 toget the number of watts.
(Amps x Volts =Watts, and most U.S. electricity is ~120 volts. So a hotplate rated at 6 amps uses 6 x 120 = 720 watts, on thehighest setting. Most other countries use 240 voltsinstead of 120, so outside of North America and Japan use240 instead of 120 in your calculations.)
Notethat if a device is powered by a transformer (one of thosegreat big plugs), then the transformer has converted theelectricity from AC to DC, so you need to multiply by the DCvoltage, not the AC voltage of 120. For example, if the devicesays "INPUT 9V, 0.5A", then that's 9 volts x 0.5 amps = 4.5watts.
You may have noticed that appliances may be labeled 110,115, or 120 volts.
U.S. appliances are actuallydesigned to accept a range of voltages, between 110-120 volts,and the exact voltage coming out of your electrical socket canvary depending on conditions at the power plant and in yourown home. Let's just agree that when we say 120 volts,we understand that it's actually a range from 110-120.And just use 120 for your calculations (unless you're outsideof North America or Japan, in which case you probably have220-240 volts).
Your device might actually list a huge voltage range, like100-240V.
That just means that it will work with anycountry's voltage. For your calculations, use the voltage forthe country where you're plugging the device in.
Some important caveats:
The amount of electricity listed on the label is the
maximum
amount that the appliance will ever use.
For example,a 300-watt refrigerator will only run at 300 watts when thecompressor's running (which is when it makes that hummingsound, indicating that it's actually chilling the airinside). Most of the time the fridge just sits there, usingonly 5 watts or so for its electronics. If the amount ofwork done by a device varies up and down, then so does itsenergy use. (e.g., a stereo that can be turned up or down,an oven that can be set at various temperatures, a fridgethat sometimes runs and sometimes doesn't, a computer thatsometimes spins its various drives and sometimes has to usemore of its brainpower, etc.) The label on computers isparticularly useless; a computer labeled at 300 wattsprobably uses only about 100. (More on
computers'
electrical use
.) In just a bit we'll cover how tomeasure the actual amount of electricity being used by adevice
Many consumer items are advertised according to theirpower
output
, not
input
.
That meansthe stereo that says 30 watts on the box might actuallyrequire 50 watts to make 30 watts of sound (assuming thevolume was cranked), and your 900-watt microwave oven mightactually use 1400 watts (on its highest setting). That'sbecause all electrical devices are inefficient -- they haveto use some extra energy to do what they do.
Some devices use energy even when they're not on.
(
Standby
power
)
Exercise:
Pretend there's an energy crisis and they start rationingelectricity. You're given a bonus of 1000 watt-hoursof electricity to use because you won a specialdrawing. If you're choosing between using yourstereo or your central air conditioner, how long could yourun each? Assume that your stereo uses 30 watts and yourAC uses 3500 watts.
(see
answer)
1000
Wh
will run a 30-watt stereo for 1000 / 30 = 33 hours. 1000 Whwill run a 3500-watt AC for 1000 / 3500 = 0.29 hours (17minutes).
Exercise:
The power adapter on your laptop computer says its output is24V and 1.875 amps. The input specs aren't listed for somereason. What's the maximum number of watts your computercould ever use?
(see
answer)
24V x 1.875a = 45 watts
Your adapter could draw a little more than this, becauseit's a little inefficient at converting the 120V to 24V,but that doesn't really matter because your computer willrarely need the full 45 watts anyway (which would requireall the drives to be spinning and the processor to befully busy).

Sample electrical rate
of15/kWh.
(1) One 5000-watt central system, always on, running40mins/hr. for four months, vs. two 1500-watt heatersrunning 8 hours a day for four months. Ofcourse, not everyone cant heat their living areaadequately this way, but some can.
(2) A 2.5-ton, 3500-watt AC 24 hours a day (15mins/hr) for five months, vs. two 48" ceiling fans onhigh (75 watts each), 12 hours/day.
(3) Five 100-watt light bulbs on for 10 hours a daywhen they don't need to be.
(4) 50/load as per the
clothesdryers
page, 7.5 loads a week.
(5) Computer on for 24 hrs/day @ 160 watts, vs.sleeping 21 hrs/day @ 5 watts
(6) Electric water heater; 7.5 loads/week.
(8) CFL's are 15 watts, lights run 5.5 hours a day.
(9) 1/3 hot washes, 2/3 warm washes, water heatedelectrically, electric dryer, 7.5 loads/week. Includeswater costs.
(10) Replacing a 900 kWh/year fridge with a 400kWh/year Energy Star model. Non-Energy Starfridge costs $400 and saves $60/yr. All fridge sizesare 18cf. Fridge prices checked at Sears in Nov.2010.
