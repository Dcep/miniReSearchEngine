How tosave electricity on lighting
Last
Update:
July 2013
Lighting is is the third-biggest energy user in mosthomes.
But it's probably the easiest area to savein. You can start saving
a whopping 70-90% right away
by
simply screwing in new LED or CFL lights. And if you'reconcerned about mercury from CFL bulbs breaking, you caneither use a CFL that has a plastic cover, or use an LED bulbinstead.
Environmental
Defense
has the best explanation of what's wrong withregular light bulbs:
"Though we call them lightbulbs, traditional incandescent bulbs are actually
smallheaters that give off a little bit of light
somethingyou know if you've ever touched a bulb that's been on for awhile. These bulbs were technological wonders whenthey were patented in 1880, but today they are inefficientdinosaurs. They waste energy and money, and they areresponsible for millions of tons of global warmingpollution."

There are other easy ways to save money on lightingbesides switching bulbs,
like putting lights on timersor motion sensors, and just being more diligent about turningoff lights you're not using. A single 100-watt bulb lefton continuously will run you $12 a month (assuming 16/kWh).
That's the short summary on saving energy on yourlighting. Below are the details, as well as severalother money-saving tips.
Use CFL or LED lights.
You have two choices to replace your old-school,energy-guzzling lights: LED or CFL.
They're
both good choices, produce very good light, are directscrew-in replacements for your current bulbs, and save tonsof energy. So there's no need to obsess over which oneto choose. LED is generally better but the currentcost is still high ? $13 for an LED bulb vs. $2 for aCFL. You'll make up the extra cost for the LED fromthe energy it saves, but if you can't stomach the up-frontcost, just go with CFL. Either way, the calculator atright shows you how much you can save.
If you've heard the scare-mongering about mercury inCFLs, relax.
The median exposure for a brokenCFL is 0.07 mcg, while six ounces of Albacore tuna has 48mcg?700 times as much. (See
this
paper by LBL scientists
for more.) And ofcourse, you can always use a CFL that has a plastic cover,or use an LED light.
Here's a table showing the difference between thedifferent kind of light bulbs:

When shopping for lights, you'll probably want to choose
warm white,
which has the pleasing yellowish tint.
By contrast,
cold white
is the harsh bluishlight. The color temperature (often printed on thepackage) tells you exactly how warm or cold the lightis. Warm is 2700-3000k, and cold is 3600-5500k.

Yes,
manufacturers
fudge their numbers, and comparing apples-to-applesis difficult anyway because different bulbs sendlight in different directions. But forpractical purposes, this table is usually accurateenough. And despite some claims that LEDs requirejust as many watts as CFLs to output the same amountof light, my own test showed an 8w LED to becomparable to a 13w CFL.
Many online retailers don't bother to tell you howbright their LED lights are in watt-equivalents.
A rule of thumb is to just multiply the LED wattage by6. So if you're looking at a 10-watt LED, it's a60-watt equivalent. I also recommend checking thelumens, which is a measure of brightness. The table atright shows how many lumens you should be looking fordepending on what kind of light you're buying.
When buying CFLs, make sure they either have the EnergyStar logo or come with a warranty.
The cheaperCFLs can burn out really fast. I have a
separate
page which covers CFL's in more detail
, including thereal story behind the mercury warnings.
Halogen
lights are similar to traditionalincandescents, except they use 20-30% less energy.They're definitely inferior to CFLs and LEDs which use 73-84%less energy, but if for some reason you can't stand CFLs orLEDs, then halogens are an option.
Turn off lights when you're not usingthem, even for just a few minutes.
The idea that lights use extra electricity tostart up is a myth.
You'll save electricity
everytime
you turn the lights off, no matter how short theoff duration, and whether they're regular lights orfluorescents.
You might have heard that you wear out your lights quickerby cycling them off and on, but that effect is so small it'snot worth worrying about, and you can safely turn yourlights off every time you leave the room, no matter howshort the duration. If you feel you need to obsess over this(as evidenced from all the email I get about the subject)then see my answer about
fluorescent
cycling costs
.
Use
a motion sensor for outside lighting
Exterior security lights automatically shut offafter 1-15 minutes, so you're not paying to run them allnight. Fixtures start at $20 at home improvement stores likeHome Depot. Do not that you can't use CFL's in security lightsthough, because the fixtures cycle a very small amount ofvoltage through the lights constantly which makes the CFL'sdie a lot faster.
Exercise: You buy a security lightfor $20. The light used to be on all night, for 12 hourseach night. Now it's on for about an hour anight. You're using two 75-watt bulbs in thefixture. How long does it take for the securitylight to pay for itself? (assume electricity costs15/kWh)
(see
answer)
Old way: 2 bulbs x 75W x 12 hrs/dayx 30.5 days/mo.  1000 w/kW x $0.15/kWh = $8.24/mo.
New way: 2 bulbs x 75W x 1 hr/day x30.5 days/mo.  1000 w/kWh x $0.15/kWh = $0.69/mo.
Savings per month: $8.24 - $0.69 =$7.55
Payback time: $20 / $7.55 = 2.6months
What the hell are you waiting for?
Put nightlights onphotosensors.
You can get a simple screw-in photosensor for $4.50($8.50 for the outdoor version) which will automaticallyturn your light on at night and off during the day.
You
just screw the special socket into the existing lightsocket, then screw the light bulb into the special socket.
Exercise: How long does ittake for one of these $4.50 devices (indoor version) topay for itself, assuming you were using a 60-watt bulb,paying 15/kWh for electricity, and saving 12 hours perday of light use?
(see
answer)
Old way: 60W x 24 hrs/day x 30.5days/mo.  1000 w/kW x $0.15/kWh = $6.59/mo.
New way: 60W x 12 hrs/day x 30.5days/mo.  1000 w/kWh x $0.15/kWh = $3.29/mo.
Monthly savings:$6.59 - 3.29 =$3.30/mo.
Payback time: $4.50  3.30 = 1.4months
You can also make lamps or other devices go off during the dayand turn on at night by using a plug-in light sensor ($6). Youplug the appliance into the sensor, and then plug the sensorinto the wall. If you're handy with electrical wiring, you canmount a light sensor to a wall (like you'd mount a lightswitch or electrical outlet). Wire-in sensors are around $10.
Use a motion sensor forinterior lighting.
If you can't remember (or can't be bothered) to turnoff the lights throughout your house, a motion-sensor switchwill shut them off for you automatically. You can buymotion-sensing wall switches for as little as $10 at a homeimprovement store.
Use the lowest-wattage bulbsfor lights that are always on (e.g., stairways).
Replacing 75-watt bulbs with 15-watt bulbsreduces energy usage by 80%.
Replacing them withLED or CFL lights saves even more.
Exercise: How much do you save in ayear by replacing a 75-watt bulb with a 5-watt bulb, for alight that's on 24/7? Use 15/kWh for the cost.
(see
answer)
Old way: 75W x 24 hrs/day x 30.5days/mo.  1000 w/kW x $0.15/kWh = $8.24/mo.
New way: 5W x 24 hrs/day x 30.5days/mo.  1000 w/kWh x $0.15/kWh = $0.55/mo.
Savings per month:$8.24 - $0.55 =$7.69 (93%!)
Replace fluorescent magnetic ballastswith electronic ones.
For long-tube fluorescent lighting (as opposed toscrew-in compact fluorescents), an old-style magnetic ballastmight use 100W to power two 40W tubes, while an electronicballast might use only 60W. Also, the electronic ballasteliminates flicker and usually eliminates hum. They alsogenerate less heat, which saves additional money on cooling.
Install a skylight.
Using natural lighting saves a bunch of energy andproduces a much nicer environment besides. Modern skylightsare available which let in only the light and not the heat.
Use LED holiday lights.
LED Christmas lights use 84% less electricitythan standard holiday lights
(which use 25 watts in atypical 50-bulb strand). LED lights also generate much lessheat, so they're less likely to catch your Christmas tree onfire. Another advantage is that the LED's are virtuallyindestructible?they don't burn out like normal bulbs (not forabout ten years, anyway), and they're not fragile like normalholiday lights. I actually unsuccessfully tried to crushone by standing on it on a concrete surface. I broke thedecorative casing but was unable to break the LED bulbitself?it still lit up just fine when I plugged it back in.
I put a few strands of LED Xmas lights on the ceiling and useit as mood lighting. (Yeah, I know the packaging saysnot to use them for permanent installations, but that's justhow I roll.)
Inirgee
sells
a
nice variety of LED lights
in a variety of colors:120V holiday light strings, and 12V holiday light strings tobe powered from a battery. Notably, most of the productscarry a
lifetime
warranty.
I have a separate page about
rewiring
Christmas
lights to run off batteries
.
Use solar or LED landscape lighting
Replacing your old landscape lighting with solaror LED can save a fair amount of money.
Don't befooled into thinking your existing lights are low-energy justbecause they're "low-voltage". A low-voltage system usesthe same amount of energy as a high-voltage system, since it'sthe watt-hours you get charged for, not the volts.
Solar lights are great, but absolutely buy a model with awarranty.
Many of the cheap solar landscape lightson the market now last only a year or two before the solarpanel wears out and the lights are useless. Yes, I knowthe price is really attractive, but don't skip the warranty!
