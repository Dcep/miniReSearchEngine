I
f you've got an
electric toothbrush
with a
plastic
bottom, you might have marveled at how it charges up apparently by magic standing on what seems to be a plastic stand! How do two bits of plastic charge up the
battery
inside your toothbrush
when there is no direct metallic contact between them? How on Earth can electricity
flow between two plastic insulators?
What's happening here is a neat trick called
induction charging
and we're about to take a closer look at how it works. If you don't already know the basics of how ordinary electric transformers work, you might like to take a quick look at our article on
transformers
before you continue.
If you'd like to know about other kinds of chargers, you might prefer to look at our article on
battery chargers
.
Photo: An electric toothbrush standing on its induction charger. The battery in the brush charges up even though there is no direct electrical contact between the plastic brush and the plastic charger unit in the base. So how does electricity pass through two layers of plastic?
How ordinary chargers work
Most of the small
electronic
appliances we use in our homes work on relatively low voltagestypically 5-10 percent as much voltage as hefty electric appliances like
vacuum cleaners
and
clothes washers
. That means we generally need to use
transformers
to "step down" the domestic voltage so it will safely power electronic gadgets without blowing them up. All those chargers you have (little boxes attached to wires that plug into things like your
MP3 player
and
cellphone
) actually have electricity transformers hiding inside.
It's easy to understand how these simple chargers work:
electricity
flows
into the charger from the electricity outlet on your wall.
Inside the charger, a
transformer
"steps down" the electricity to a much lower voltage. The low-voltage current then flows from the charger into the
battery
in your appliance. The important thing to note is that
all three parts of the transformer (the
primary coil
,
the
secondary coil
, and the
iron core
linking
them together) are contained inside the charger:

How induction chargers work
So far so goodbut what happens with something like an
electric toothbrush
, which has no power lead to plug into the wall? When you stand the toothbrush on its charger, how does the electricity flow from its plastic-coated base into the battery inside the brush when plastic is an insulator (that is, doesn't allow electricity to flow through it)?
It's not magic we have hereit's just another kind of transformer in a cunning disguise.
An electric toothbrush and its charger use a transformer just like a cellphone
or an MP3 player, but it's cleverly split into two pieces, with half the transformer in the bottom of the toothbrush and the rest of it in the charger base it stands on:
Artwork: Induction charging: half the transformer is in the toothbrush; half is in the stand.
The primary coil is in the charger base and it has an iron peg on top
of it covered in plastic. The secondary coil is in the base of the
toothbrush, which you stand on the iron peg. What's the peg for? It's not just to stop the toothbrush
wobbling about: it's the core that links the primary and secondary
coils together
electromagnetically
.  When the toothbrush is standing on the peg, you've got a complete
transformer that works by electromagnetic induction:
energy
flows from the coil in the base to
the coil in the toothbrush via the iron peg that links them.
The two ends of the coil in the toothbrush are simply hooked up to the rechargeable
battery inside.
Photo (left): The bottom of an electric toothbrush has a hole in it so it sits securely on the "peg" on the baseactually the core of the transformer. The copper coil (right) is just above the plastic base, running around the hole.
A charger that works like this is called an
induction
charger
. Safety is the main reason for using an induction charger in the bathroom: 
you don't need a power cable or exposed leads coming out of the base of your toothbrush, which typically gets wet.
Electric shavers often use induction chargers for the same reason.
Photo (right): The
copper
charging coil from inside an electric toothbrush. The coil works as the secondary coil of a transformer. It's fitted at the very base of the brush and sits around the little iron peg on the charger stand when the brush is sitting on its base. The two leads from the coil connect to the rechargeable battery inside the toothbrush.
How does a Powermat work?
Wireless mat-type chargers (sold under the trademarked brand name Powermat) are induction chargers too. The mat works as one part of a transformer (essentially like the stand of an electric toothbrush), while the other part of the transformer is either a circuit embedded inside your device (like the coil inside the base of a toothbrush), a pad that clips onto the back on your device, or, for a cellphone, a replacement battery cover with a built-in charging coil that connects to the charging socket. There's no magic involved: it's just electromagnetic induction again!
Artwork: A Powermat uses exactly the same principle as an electric toothbrush charger. If you have a cellphone mat charger, it works like this. One part of the charger (the primary coil) is inside the mat. The other part clips onto the back of your phone, usually as a replacement battery cover. This bit contains the other part of the charger (the secondary coil) and connects to your phone's charger port (or the battery's terminals inside the phone).
