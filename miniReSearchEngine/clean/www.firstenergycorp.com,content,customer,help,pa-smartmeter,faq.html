receive a brochure
in the mail to provide you with information about the meter and the installation process. A few weeks prior to the actual installation date, you will
receive a letter
that will give you the time period when we will be in your area to exchange your meter.On the day of the installation, an installer will come to your door to let you know they are installing your meter.If no one is home, we will leave a
door hanger
either indicating that the meter has been changed or asking you to contact us to schedule an appointment to change your meter.

In addition to mailings, the installer will come to your door before beginning work.Appointments for special needs will be handled on a case-by-case basis.

How can I tell if my meter is a smart meter?
Smart meters are digital, so they will display numbers instead of dials. In addition, our smart meters have a blue stripe across the face.

Will power to my home or business be interrupted during the meter installation?
For homes, there will be a brief interruption in your electric service when the meter is being installed, so you may need to reset some of your electronic equipment. For businesses, your power might be interrupted during the installation. The meter installer will be able to determine if an interruption will occur when the work is being done.

Will unauthorized people be able to monitor my account to learn more about how I use energy in my home?
Smart meters measure how much energy is used, based on time of day  not how that energy is used. A smart meter cannot tell which specific electric equipment is using the energy. The companys smart meter solution is based on industry best practices, and built on a secured network designed to protect customer data.
Check here for more information about how FirstEnergy is helping keep your information secure.

Home Energy Analyzer tool

Are smart meters as accurate as my current meter?
Smart meters use state-of-the-art technologies that ensure accurate readings while providing customers with information they need to better manage their electricity use.Like the meters of today, we test each smart meter according to stringent American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standards to ensure they are accurate. Click here for our
Fact Sheet on Accuracy.
Return To Top
Will I receive fewer estimated bills with a smart meter?
Yes. Since we will be able toread smart meters remotely, we will have easier access to the meter information. Please note that this functionality will be implemented over time, so meter readers will continue to manually read the smart meter for some time after the meter is installed.
Return To Top
How do you know that the information you get is for my meter and not my neighbors?
Data collected from a meter and transmitted wirelessly contains specific, unique identifiers associated with the customer's meter number and service address. These fields are validated numerous times to ensure accuracy before the data is used for billing.
Return To Top
Will I be exposed to radio frequencies from smart meter equipment?
While smart meters emit a low level of radio frequency (RF), RF exposure from smart meters is a fraction of the level that comes from other commonly used household devices, such as cell phones, garage door openers, televisions, baby monitors, microwaves and wireless internet. Also, advanced metering systems only transmit data for a few seconds per hour, and at average levels far below the safety standards specified by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).

Fact Sheet on Radio Frequency.

I have a smart meter, so why am I still seeing meter readers?
Although the smart meter has been installed, the functionality of the meter will be implemented over time  meaning, the company is gathering your usage information but must also then evaluate and verify the accuracy for some time before we start using that information for billing.
