Am I eligible for a discount rate?
What is budget billing?
What is a payment plan?
How can I reduce my utility bills through conservation?
How can I dispute my utility bill?
Am I eligible for protection from being shut off?
Financial hardship
You are protected from having your electric or gas service shut off if you have a financial hardship
AND
you, or someone in your home, is seriously ill; or
you have an infant in the home under 12 months; or
it is between November 15 and March 15 and you need the service to heat your home; or
all adults in the home are age 65 or older and a minor child resides in the home.
A
financial hardship
exists when a customer is unable to pay an overdue bill and such customer meets income eligibility requirements for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program ("LIHEAP") administered by the Department of Housing and Community Development. You may be eligible for assistance if your household income does not exceed 60% of the state median income. More information can be found on the
Department of Housing and Community Development
website. To determine your eligibility, look in the "60% of Estimated State Median Income " column of the recent LIHEAP Income Eligibility Chart
220 C.M.R. 25.01
information. Alternatively, the Department of Public Utilities may determine that a financial hardship exists.
220 C.M.R. 25.01.
If you have a financial hardship, you should inform your utility company immediately. Your company will send you a certifying form. You will have seven days to return it to the Company with documentation supporting your need for protection.
If you are age 65 or older
Utility companies may not shut off service to households where all residents are 65 years or older without written approval from the Department of Public Utilities. If all residents of your household are over age 65, you should inform your utility company.
220 C.M.R. 25.05

Am I eligible for a discount rate?
If you either (1) receive any means-tested public-benefit program or (2) are eligible for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), you may be eligible for a discount rate from your gas and electric companies.
220 C.M.R. 11.04 (5)

220 C.M.R. 11.04 (5)

LIHEAP

What is budget billing?
Budget billing is an arrangement you make with your utility company for equal monthly payments.
220 CMR 25.01(2), 25.02(6)
. Your gas or electric usage is estimated for the year, divided by 12 months, and you pay the same amount each month. However, if you are using more or less energy than estimated, your bill may be increased or decreased during the year. Your actual consumption is available on each monthly bill. At the end of the year, your company will reconcile your bill with the amount actually used. Then you will receive a credit if you overpaid or a bill if you underpaid. By the end of the year, you will have been billed for the actual amount used.
Contact your utility company
to set up a budget plan.
Back to Top
What is a payment plan?
A payment plan is a payment arrangement for overdue charges.
220 CMR 25.01(2), 25.02(6)
. A monthly payment is due in addition to your current monthly bill.
Contact your utility company
to set up a payment plan. If you have a billing dispute with your utility company, you may contact the
DPUs Consumer Division
.
