TSA Travel Tips: Enhanced Security Measures for Electronic Devices at Certain Airports Overseas
This
weeks travel tip is for passengers traveling out of overseas airports.
Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson recently
directed
TSA to implement enhanced security measures
at certain overseas airports
with direct flights to the United States.
Electronic
devices are already screened daily, but now, security officers might ask that
you power up your devices, including cell phones. Powerless devices will not be
permitted onboard the aircraft, so its important to have them charged prior to
going through security.
See
you next week with more travel tips.

Does the device need to simply turn on or does it need to boot up all the way?  For instance, when my iPad gets very low on battery (which happens frequently when traveling), it powers on immediately but only flashes a "low battery" message and icon.  It doesn't boot all the way.  Would this pass inspection?
Thanks!

How will non-battery operated electronics be dealt with? For example, As you are requiring items to be powered up, I assume that you will make a mains socket available for use.

Why are powerless devices not allowed? What's the concern there?
I remember 20 years ago when almost no one had a laptop, I had to power up the laptop to prove it worked.
What's the deal? Thanks.

One option you should have for the travelers is to be able to charge the device on the spot and show it. I carry multiple phones as backups and don't remember to charge them all the time!
Another inconvenience for frequent travelers!

I am very concerned that I will no longer be able to travel with my external hard drive that I use for backing up photos and videos while traveling. Go to http://gearpatrol.com/2013/03/14/die-hard-drives-5-best-rugged-drives/ to get a sense of what such a device looks like. It's bigger than a phone, and has no screen. At most it has an LED light to show it's on.
Will the light going on be sufficient?
And if so, doesn't that point out the lunacy of this policy, that a light which requires nearly no power to turn on is sufficient evidence that a large electronic device is indeed what the traveler purports it to be and that it hasn't been tampered with?

To follow up on the question about portable hard drives, most don't even have their own power source, and instead use a computer's power. So will I be required to show that the hard drive can mount on laptop?

What happens when someone powers on a device and the checkpoint line disappears in a flash?
It's summertime, folk, and DHS/TSA has to come up with some way to keep the populace frightened and compliant.

I question the effectiveness of this policy.  Shouldn't you be able to see if something isn't right with these electronics with the x-ray machine?
Even if you can't see if something is wrong, wouldn't the terrorists just make it so the device could power on normally?  If not, wouldn't they just make it so the power button is the detonator?  In that case, a densely packed checkpoint would be destroyed instead of a plane.
What happens to the electronics that can't be powered up?  Will a passenger be allowed to leave the checkpoint to ship or check the device?  Will a passenger be allowed to plug it in at the checkpoint to try to turn it on?  Will it just be tossed in the garbage along with all of the other dangerous liquids?

If it's TSA, there's no science.  These are the same folks who are still lying about "explosive liquids" eight years after overseas law enforcement broke up a pirely aspirational plot by a bunch of losers who didn't even have airplane tickets.  Right, Curtis Burns and West Cooper?

Very confusing. This is akin to most laws or policies. Whether researched or not, they appear to be not researched and hastily passed. Very good questions here.
What about external hard drives? What about battery backups? Battery backups are just that, a large battery for the purpose of recharging on a long flight. But some are large and may arouse suspicion. I just called the TSA help line and they don't seem to know. Any thoughts?

Yes. Because everyone knows a fully charged batter is so much safer than an discharged battery.
Can the TSA explain in any way the reasons for this bit of security theater?
And while you compose your carefully worded non-answer let me deflect you away from what will be the obvious answer....
A laptop battery, for example, is about so-big. An equal amount of explosive will look like a battery on the x-ray machine. OK, fine.... power up the laptop to make sure it is a battery and not a bomb.
But....
There is, believe it or not, a lot of empty space inside of a laptop, plenty of space to put in the bad stuff AND still leave the battery in place.
Or....
A smaller batter that will power up the screen and keep it running for a minute or three with a slightly smaller amount of bad stuff.
Or....
Not even bother with the laptop idea and just just pack the power supply with bad stuff. It is a bigger space, is already heavy, and unless you are providing a mains to plug into is going to go relatively unnoticed.
Or.... you don't check baggage. At least not to anything anyone would call a secure standard. So why wouldn't the bad guys simply check their bomb in the luggage with a timer?
And I'm not even a bad guy and I just thought up three ways to get around your silly request to power on electronics.
You have to go away TSA. You need to follow the same model as the FAA.... you write the standards that others have to follow and get out of the business of providing the actual security because you have proven time and time again that you can't do it effectively. At all.

I'm surprised this wasn't a standard inspection already. If a seemingly electronic device is not able to power up and be functional, then it isn't what it appears to be. It is hubris to assume that a terrorist (homegrown or otherwise) is not creative and gifted with intelligence.

RB, TSA cannot mandate what technology airlines or foreign airports use to screen people/property. They have to enure that they meet security levels and to do that they have to find the "lowest tech" ways to do so.  Plus, this is an early roll out.  To assume that all airports around the world have ETD machines is slightly silly.

Yes!
Because we should all have to give up something so fundamental as travelling just so you can feel comfortable and safe.
Wouldn't you prefer to have actual security? Something that actually made you safe? Wouldn't you prefer to choose the more adult model and take responsibility for your own safety instead of handing that responsibility over to a bunch of folks that have silly policies like taking water away from you because it might be dangerous but who then throw it in a giant bin next to the checkpoint because its not like it is dangerous or anything......

The TSA puts this vague statement out, but refuses to address any of the questions that follow. That makes me think that they didn't think this policy through and have no answers. I'll tell you one thing; if a TSA agent tries to confiscate any of my electronic equipment, we will have very big problems.

Still, the terrorists are ahead of TSA. The security hole may be fixed in electronics but the terrorists are implanting explosives on suicidal terrorists, either in body cavities or surgically. Time to utilise full body cavity searches on all passengers and crew and disallow anyone with healing scars from travel. America has to get serious about security.

Secretary Johnson's statement that you link to says
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING
about electronic devices. So why then does your blog post have "Electronic Devices" in the title? If there is a directive regarding electronic devices, please provide the correct link. Otherwise, stop misleading the public with unofficial statements about electronic devices. Where is the official statement FROM SECRETARY JOHNSON that says "Powerless devices will not be permitted onboard the aircraft".

How will you clear battery cases, such as these?
http://www.macworld.com/article/2045268/review-best-battery-cases-for-the-iphone-5.html
The entire device
is
a battery, and the battery by itself has no way of indicating that it's actually on.
As others have pointed out, this seems like a very ill-thought out policy that adds no security and is full of so many loopholes that I can drive a 747 through.

Are you trying to say that the presence of an LED light is sufficient to prove that the divide is not a bomb?
And in the stock photo you used in this post, how will you prove that a device's power is really that?

Really, then how can TSA mandate screening processes to sovereign countries?
In this particular instance TSA is mandating that all electronics will be shown to functioning or they will be confiscated.
If fact why should the United States have any say in how another country conducts security screenings?

I saw a story on NBC last night that said some people on US domestic flights will have to power on their devices.  It sounds like this program is being expanded.  Will everyone flying in the US have to power on their devices eventually?
What happens to devices that can't power up?  Does a passenger get to leave screening to mail or check the device?  For some reason I see a bunch of screeners taking home a lot of expensive electronics. If someone doesn't take them home, I hope such dangerous devices aren't allowed to be thrown in an ordinary trash can like so many dangerous water bottles.

If you read the CFR it is not the country who is responsible for screening, but the airline who is responsible.  The screening can be done by the airline, at the gate for example, or the country can take over that security procedure for the airline.  The TSA is not telling countries what to do.  It is telling AIRLINES who fly in and out of the U.S. what to do.  They can do this by law because the TSA regulates these companies.  I am a nerd and like reading Codes of Federal Regulations.

I
am
fully qualified to expect the government to which I pay taxes to provide cost-benefit assessments to justify its expenditure of tax dollars on things like the liquid ban, the BDO program, the whole body scanners, and this latest policy on electronic devices. I am fully qualified to expect my government to answer reasonable questions about said policy.

It looks like the TSA is changing its rules so if someone shows up at an airport and you demand he turn on his phone, and it won't power up, that the TSA will NOT allow the flyer to go put it in his car, give it to a friend, mail it, etc. Instead, the TSA will immediately confiscate the phone.

Everybody: Configure a password/gesture/keycode security on your phones, tablets, laptops, etc, so that your desktop/homescreen is _not_ visible upon power up or "swiping" of the screen after power up.
As of the supreme court decision about device searches requiring a search warrant, anything that a pretend-LEO or actual LEO sees will be used to justify an "justifiable suspicion" search (read:unwarranted and illegal) search of your electronic devices. This is because once they see your desktop/screen, your entire device qualifies as "unlocked" and therefore "in plain view" searchable container.

"The rule change may be obnoxious, but its not stupid, says Rafi Ron, the former director of security at Tel Avivs Ben-Gurion International Airport, notorious for its strict screening procedures. The TSA is likely responding to new intelligence that al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) has developed explosives that are difficult to detect with current technology, Ron says. That calls for a change in procedure."

Does that really surprise anyone? TSA had no problem implementing what amounts to an internal passport system with the ID requirement, including gender and DOB, but waives it for non citizens who frankly they should be concerned about.
Also am I the only peron who remembers when Bob posted on here every week how many people were caught with fake ID's at the checkpoint? Those posts seem to have gone away likely due to political concerns since it always well the same demographic as above instead of terrorists.

I have mentioned several reasons in the past of why the TSA is security theater. The first and foremost reason is the apparent lack of any risk analysis. One has to take into an account how likely an event is to occur, the costs of the event occurring, and the cost to prevent the event from occurring. Terrorism is a very rare event. Preventing terrorism is worthwhile, but because of the rarity, not at the current prices (both monetary and other). And yes, I have a blog (I've linked to it in the past), but I currently do not cover security on it.

What of battery banks?  I am a very frequent traveler for my job and carry one to charge my phone or MiFi device if I am in a spot where I have no access to AC (like the airport and everyone has the outlets taken up).  This is going to slow security down immensely.  I would have to power up half a dozen devices to show them to be OK.
I agree with the theater comments.  I know people who have boarded planes with knives and one fellow who boarded not once but twice with a folding camping saw that could cut a man's head off.
Now with illegals being allowed to board with easily counterfeited "documents" it is even worse.
I don't feel one iota safer going through this charade.
