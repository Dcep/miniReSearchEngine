How can I shield my Smart meter?
A Smart meter is a radiofrequency (RF) emitting device that the utility company has installed on your gas or electric meter. The RF signal emitted transmits information back to the utility company about your gas or electric usage. The signal is intermittent, but operates 24/7. Usually, the utility company will not permit you to completely block this transmission. However, you can shield your body and your living space to minimize the amount of RF exposure
you
receive.
If you are also concerned about the magnetic field emissions (due to the presence of electric current), see
magnetic shielding material
and the
magnetic shielding FAQ
.
There are two main categories of shielding materials that can be used:
RF reflectors
and
RF absorbers
An
RF reflector
will cause the majority of the signal to bounce off, somewhat like a mirror reflects light. It can have very high shielding performance, and in general should be grounded for peak efficiency. It will usually offer better shielding (less RF transmission) than an absorbing material.
An
RF absorber
will absorb the much of the signal, and minimize reflection. The energy absorbed is released as a tiny, almost unmeasurable amount of heat. Grounding is usually not needed.
In both cases, SOME amount of RF does get through the shield, as no shield is 100% effective. You can use double or triple layers of shielding to improve performance.
So where should I put the shield? And how much area do I need to cover?
First, the shield must be positioned BETWEEN you and the source of the radiation. Generally, this means that the shield will be placed on the interior surface of the wall adjacent to the Smart meter. Think about the Smart meter emissions as coming from a light bulb located at the meter, and the shield casting a shadow. 
Cover enough wall so that the people would be in the protective "shadow" cast by the shield. Notice the small shield in the floor plan at right. In this example, the majority of the bedroom area is protected, but that is not true for the rest of the living space.
So which one is right for your situation? 
In a hypothetical world where your Smart meter is the only source of RF radiation, either absorbers or reflectors would work well. However, in the real world, there will be multiple sources of RF radiation. Some of them might be right inside your own home. Some might be coming from other directions. In such a situation, if you use a reflecting material, it will reflect on BOTH sides, and you could end up increasing the amount of RF in your living space. On the other hand, if you use an absorber, it will absorb on BOTH sides, so you cannot increase your exposure. If, you use both materials, a reflector on the side closest to the RF source, and an absorber on the side closest to the living space, you get the best of both materials... and the absolute lowest RF transmission. 

Any small amount of Smart meter signal penetrating the reflector will be absorbed by the absorber. Any signal coming from the opposite direction will have to pass through the absorber, then reflect off the reflector, and finally pass through the absorber again before it re-enters the living space. This would be a very small amount indeed.
SMART METER SHIELD KIT
Everything You Need for Effective RF Shielding
We get this question a lot: How do I shield my smart meter? Remember, you want the shield to be placed between the source of radiation and the people you wish to protect. 
And it would be nice if the shield didnt reflect radiation back towards the people. In this kit, you get everything youll need to set up a simple but effective shield for the brain jarring beat of the smart meter. It covers an ample area of 8x7 feet and includes an RF reflector, an absorber material, mounting tape and ground cord. With these 2 layers, almost no radiation can get through and this is easily demonstrated with the proper RF meter. Clear instructions show you how to attach it to the interior of the wall on which the smart meter is mounted. You can cover it with any decorative finish you like. Great for both long term or short term (removable) situations. Your smart meter is pulsing out microwaves right now. Shield yours today!
Smart Meter Shield Kit (Cat. #1219) ........... $349.95
Need to cover a larger area?
You can order additional material:
Nickel/Copper RipStop (Cat. #A1213) ..... $12.95 per lin ft
MW Absorbing Sheet (Cat. #A259N) ......... $8.95 per lin ft
Which shielding materials do you recommend?
Reflectors for a wall:
Fabric such as
Ni/Cu Ripstop
is a good choice. Use two layers and be sure to ground them.
Paints such as
Y-Shield
and
CuPro-Cote
are good choices.
Drapes and curtains for windows:
VeilShield
and
High Performance Silver Mesh
allow good light penetration.
Absorber for a wall:
Laminated MW Absorber
is a convenient, 48 inch wide film that is very low cost and easy to install.
You can cover over your shielding materials with almost any decorative medium that you like. The shielding should be protected from abrasion, excessive flexing, and moisture.
Shielding Garments and Bedding:
Find a variety of shielding
hats, shirts, gloves and more
to wear on your body.
These
unique Swiss fabrics
can be used to make washable shielded bedding and clothing.
Use a
Faraday canopy
to make shielded enclosure.
A portable
Shielded Sleeping Bag
is also available.
Which meters do you recommend?
We recommend the
High Frequency Meter
or
We recommend the
Acoustimeter
These 2 meters have fast enough response to measure the short radiation bursts.
