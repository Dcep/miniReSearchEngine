Using the Energy Star calculator for pool pumps
ENERGY STAR  Calculator Shows
How Pool Pumps Can Save Hundreds of Dollars
in Yearly Energy Costs
By Robert Huang,  Lauren Mattison of Cadmus and Steve Ryan, EPA ENERGY STAR Program
The ENERGY STAR program, run by the U.S. Environmental  Protection Agency (EPA), is well known for promoting energy-saving products including  refrigerators, TVs, and air conditioners. In 2013, ENERGY STAR started  certifying in-ground pool pumps.Pumps that have earned ENERGY STAR certification can run at set different speeds (i.e., two-speed pumps) or be  programmed to operate at the appropriate speed (i.e., variable speed pumps). By  using lower speeds, ENERGY STAR certified pool pumps can save homeowners hundreds  of dollars every year. Since the  certification of pool pumps began in February 2013, more than 100 pool pump  models have earned the ENERGY STAR , including models made by leading  manufacturers such as:
Pentair Aquatic Systems
Hayward Industries, Inc.
Speck Pumps-Pool Products, Inc.
Waterway Plastics, Inc.
SpectraLight Technologies
Zodiac Pool Systems
NOTE:  ENERGY STAR certified pool pumps are limited to in-ground residential pool pumps  between 0.5 and 4 horsepower.
ENERGY STAR Pool Pump  Calculator Makes the Case for Efficiency
As with many advanced, more efficient products, ENERGY STAR certified pool pumps cost more to purchase.  However, that incremental cost is easily recovered in energy savings in  less than 2 years. ENERGY STAR has created a savings  calculator to make it easy for pool professionals and home owners to see the benefits  of an ENERGY STAR certified pool pump. The  calculator, available at
www.energystar.gov/poolpumps
, allows you to estimate  potential savings based on these inputs shown in Figure 1 (below):
Location
Electric rate
Months per year of pool operation
Pool size, in gallons (which can be determined with the  included pool size estimator)
Size and operation of conventional pump
ENERGY STAR pump being considered

If any  of these inputs are not known, the calculator defaults to values vetted by industry  experts. Pool pump professionals and  other advanced users can see all of the calculations and adjust assumptions  such as energy factor and flow rates. Pump costs and utility rebates can also be  entered to determine the net savings and payback period for the ENERGY STAR  pump.
As  shown in the calculator results page in Figure 2 (below), an ENERGY STAR certified pool  pump can:
Save approximately 74% of the pool pump energy use or $320  annually.
Pay back in less than 1.7 years.
Save more than $2,000 over the 10-year lifetime of the pool  pump.
Reduce greenhouse gas emissions from power plants by two tons  annually.

In  addition to these savings, many electric utility companies offer rebates to  customers who buy ENERGY STAR certified pool pumps. As shown in Figure 3, these utility  incentives range from $100 to $400.  Please check with you local utility to see if you can receive an  incentive by choosing an ENERGY STAR pump and submitting a simple application  form.
It's a No Brainer to  Buy ENERGY STAR
In  addition to thousands of dollars in lifetime savings and generous utility  incentives, ENERGY STAR certified pool pumps are also quieter and last longer  than conventional pool pumps  making them an easy choice for new or  replacement pool pumps.
