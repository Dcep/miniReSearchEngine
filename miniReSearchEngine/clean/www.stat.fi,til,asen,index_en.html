Energy consumption in households went down by six per cent in 2013. Energy consumption in households, that is, heating of residential buildings and household appliances amounted to 63,427 gigawatt hours (GWh). As a result of the warm weather, the consumption of heating energy in residential buildings fell by six per cent. The energy consumption of household appliances went down by five per cent. For example, the lower use of car interior heating decreased consumption. The data are based on Statistics Finland's statistics on energy consumption in households.
