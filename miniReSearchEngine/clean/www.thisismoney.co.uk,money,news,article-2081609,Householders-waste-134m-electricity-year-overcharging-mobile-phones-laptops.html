Householders waste 134m on electricity every year overcharging mobile phones and laptops

Householders waste 134million a year overcharging gadgets such as mobile phones and laptop computers, according to a study.
One in five Britons leave their 
devices plugged in once the battery is full because they are scared of 
running out of power when they leave the house.
But one in ten admit they are simply too lazy to pull the plug even though it costs them money.
Power drain: UK homeowners are burning a staggering 134million every year by overcharging gadgets such as laptops and mobile phones
A massive nine in ten owners keep gadgets on permanent charge, often unaware of the damage it could be doing, energy firm E.ON found.
Overcharging batteries reduces their lifespan and increases household electricity bills by an average 60 per year.
But a quarter of us wrongly assume constantly charging our gadgets keeps them working properly.

The most overcharged devices are laptop computers, mobile phones and iPods at 43 per cent, 41 per cent and 10 per cent, respectively, the study found.
But we also overcharge electric toothbrushes, hand-held vacuum cleaners and cordless landline phones.
GADGET CHARGING TIMES
Mobile Phone - 2 hours
Laptop, with Express Charge - 2 hours
Hand-held vacuum cleaner - 3.5 hours
Mp3 player - 4 hours
Digital Camera - 2 hours
People aged 18 to 24 are the biggest perpetrators, being four times more likely to stay plugged-in than those aged 55 and over.
And a third of women say they simply 'forget' their devices are plugged in.
Children are also adding to energy bills, with 20 per cent of kids keeping toys on regular charge.
Pollyanna Woodward, a presenter on Channel 5s The Gadget Show, said people do not realise the harm overcharging can do.
'There is clearly a lot of confusion about whats good for our electronics and it is astonishing that 90 per cent of people overcharge their gadgets,' she said.
'Overcharging a gadget can often do more harm than good.
'It can reduce the lifespan of batteries but, more importantly, it also prevents people from making easy savings on their energy bill.
'By spending a few minutes unplugging ten common household gadgets when they are fully charged could save around 60 a year.'
Wasteful: A quarter of us wrongly assume constantly charging our gadgets keeps them working properly
Just under half of Britons, 46 per cent, say they would remove their gadgets from constant charge if they knew money savings could be made.
Emma Thompson, from E.ON, said: 'Were using more and more gadgets in our daily lives.
'Its crucial that we keep an eye on how much money and energy were wasting keeping them charging when we dont need to.
'It only takes small steps to get Energy Fit and make significant savings.
'For example, when you plug in a charger, think about how long it needs to reach full charge, rather than just leaving it on overnight.
'Generally mobile phones only take two hours to charge but most people leave them plugged in overnight.
'By unplugging your gadgets once theyre charged, youll be helping to reduce your energy bills.'
