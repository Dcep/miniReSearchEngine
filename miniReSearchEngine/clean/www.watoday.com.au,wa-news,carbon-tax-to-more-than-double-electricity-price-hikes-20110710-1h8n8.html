West Australian families will have to pay a predicted 13 per cent rise in the cost of electricity as of next year, after the introduction of the new carbon tax.
Premier Colin Barnett has warned the state government could not afford to absorb the new tax, which will see power bills rise an extra 8 per cent, or $115 a year, on top of the 5 per cent hike already budgeted.
The state is not in a position to absorb Julia Gillard's carbon tax, so that will flow directly to consumers.
The scheme, which will come into effect from July 1 next year, shows that the average hits to households will be $9.90 a week, or $515 a year, based on electricity rising by $3.30 a week, gas by $1.50 a week and food bills by an average 80 cents a week.
Colin Barnett has foreshadowed even higher power bill rises after the carbon tax is increased.
The average assistance will be $10.10 a week, or $525 a year, in which 60 per cent of earners will receive an annual tax cut of at least $300, or about $6 a week. The tax cuts will operate by lifting the tax-free threshold from $6000 to $18,200 on July 1, 2012, and to $19,400 in 2015.

Mr Barnett said he took responsibility for the price increases that had begun since he took office in mid-2008, with a predicted overall hike of $1000 to consumers by the end of his first term. But he said the tax did not form part of the state's cost-recovery plan for the generation and distribution of energy.
"The extra $200-250 million cost to (power generator) Verve will be a direct impact on the cost of electricity to consumers," he said.
"The state is not in a position to absorb Julia Gillard's carbon tax, so that will flow directly to consumers. I am sorry about that but that is the decision that Julia Gillard made.
"I take full responsibility for the increases in prices that the state government imposed. Those rises in prices, as unpopular as they are, were necessary to cover the cost in actually producing and distributing electricity.
"The carbon tax imposed today will not do anything to meet the cost of producing and distributing electricity. So this is just a tax, it's not paying for the service."
Mr Barnett said while he welcomed a tax-free threshold for middle-income earners rising from around $6000 to $18,000, he believed the majority of the population, including pensioners, would eventually feel the pinch.
He wanted more direct measures like funding for public transport, such as the state's proposed light-rail link to the northern suburbs, and encouraging the conversion to gas, rather than compensating coal-centric states on the east coast.
"Simple policy, mandate at least half to three-quarters of new power generation in Australia (be converted) to natural gas, that will do more to reduce emissions," he said.
He denied that the eastern states did not have enough gas to make the switch and went as far as to say that it could be transported from WA to the east.
"Why not transport it as liquefied natural gas from the west to the east?" he said. "If the rest of the world can buy our clean gas energy, why can't the rest of Australia?" He said renewable energy use in Western Australia had reached its limit and gas was the only real solution.
Mr Barnett also held concerns for generating more wealth in the state through the expansion of the mining sectors' programs to include more processing plants based locally rather than offshore.
"If I look forward, I am very concerned what we are trying to do in this state is get more value added to our natural resources, more processing and the like. Now processing of minerals is, by its nature, energy-intensive," he said.
"This will make it less likely for investment to take place in mineral processing. It will also make it less likely for investment to take place and for success in local content; higher production of materials; and more local content in major engineering projects because, by its nature, that is also energy-intensive. So I think that will be damaging to Western Australian industry, particularly the mining sector."
Miners threaten to move offshore
His fears were largely confirmed by Chamber of Minerals and Energy of Western Australia acting director James Edwards, who said its members would examine going offshore in order to remain competitive on a global stage.
"The resources sector acknowledges that sustained global action is required to reduce the scale of human-induced climate change, but the legislation released by the Prime Minister today exposes the industry and reduces our international competitiveness," he said yesterday.
"Australia's ability to avoid serious economic downturn during the Global Financial Crisis was largely due to the strength of the mining and resources sector. The carbon tax and the proposed Minerals Resources Rent Tax put this strength at risk."
He said small mining groups would be the worst affected by the tax.
Criticism 'hypocritical'
Opposition leader Eric Ripper has hit back at Mr Barnett's comments, calling him a "hypocrite".
"He personally supported a price on carbon and an emissions trading scheme in 2009 when Malcolm Turnbull was supporting such a scheme," Mr Ripper said.
"And the second thing is his concern about the impact of cost increases on WA families when he's increased electricity prices by 50 per cent since he came to power and water prices by 45 per cent.
"It's very rich for him to complain about the impact on families when they are being compensated by federal measures while at the same time there is no compensation for his state measures."
He said while Mr Barnett criticised the scheme for being east-coast centric due assistances to the coal and steel industries, he "did not note that there was assistance to the LNG industry and the alumina industry which are West Australian industries".
"The biggest impact on living standards in WA has been Mr Barnett's increases in utility cost and the biggest problem we got in this state is that many Western Australians are not benefitting from the resources boom that is occurring," he said,
Tax relief welcomed
The Western Australian Council of Social Services has welcomed compensation for low-income earners through tax cuts and increases to pensions but said there also needed to be additional targeted programs to support individual households.
"However we know that every household is different and for some homes with greater consumption pressures, the monetary assistance alone may not be enough and those individuals and families will need to be supported through other complementary energy efficiency and financial support programs," WACOSS chief executive Irina Cattalini said.
"We welcome the announcement of the $250 million Low Carbon Communities fund to support these kinds of programs.
"Initiatives like the Western Australian Hardship Efficiency Program and Hardship Utility Grants Scheme will be very important and may need to be expanded to support more households affected by the forecast increases the carbon price will have on electricity and gas.
"The government has announced that remote Indigenous communities will be supported with direct assistance to access clean affordable energy, but more details need to be provided."

What a load of bollocks!
But then we still manage to keep lowering our bill each quarter so I doubt it will effect us much. If people can't switch things off then so be it.

This is just another tax, businesses will not look to go green they will just pass the tax on to the consumer. Nothing will change except the government will be stealing more money of us.

Colin wouldn't like the inefficiency of it all.
If he were in charge he'd just add 30% to the price of everything and let the peasants fight it out amongst themselves.
Oh, hang on. He is and he did.

Plainly, Colin is actually a greenie in disguise: he now has the perfect excuse to raise electricity prices through the roof. And best of all, he can blame it all on the Federal government! At this rate, and with an Opposition Leader to "contend" with who is totally invisible most days (what's his name again - Eric... something?), Colin plainly has the job for as long as he wants it. Aren't we lucky?

Why does Barnett think that everyone is stupid? Cant believe he can come up with this rubbish and hold a straight face. When he gets off his knees to the Mining industry he may be able to see what is going on.... but I doubt it.
It is not before time that this country did something about our emissions so well done Julia. Remember that the Greens and the independents are all behind this. Perhaps that is why Colin hates it so much: independents and greens; his most hated traits in people. Pull your head out of the sand and get up to date Colin: Diesel buses and cole powered power stations are soooo last century.

So Mark...big business will just pass the costs on hey? So when another business can make the same product with less carbon emissions therefore making a cheaper product they wont push the lazy polluting company out of the market then? I've managed to get my electricity bill down even with Barnetts price hikes (except the summer air conditioning bill) as I have made an EFFORT to reduce my carbon footprint. I am happy to invest $10 a week for a clean energy future for this country.

1. Rush in a new tax which is supposed to provide an incentice to use less carbon-intensive products (eg. electricity and fuel) - and thereby help our environment and protect of future generations. 2. Negate the effect of that tax by then compensating 90% of the end users such that they are no worse, or BETTER off, than before. 2a) The 10% are the "rich" households... lets rename the Labor Party to what it should be "The Socialist Party" 3) BUY as many votes of the poor, hard-done-by', short-sighted Labor voters as they can. Has this Socialist Party stated how it measured current emissions, and what those levels are specifically? How will the current Socialist Party prove that its new Tax is having an effect? You know they will say "Oh we wont see anything for years." Nice way to dodge proving any benefit. The ONLY way "Labor" knows how to win an election is by buying votes - they have no other tools at their disposal. Its actually pathetic to listen to Labor these last 4 years it really is.

Barnett, your understanding of the scheme has disappointed me.
Our electricity is to rise by $115 as you say - but we are to be compensated the same as everyone else, as if it were to raise by the national average - $170+. This is not bad for us, this is good for us. We all get cash in pocket from the start of the tax, a reward for having cleaner power generation than the east coast.
My question - why are journalists allowing you to present this as punishment? ie Aja Styles publishes your quoted figure - $115 - and then compares it to the national average, $3.30 a week. Why not put these in the same units Aja (us = $2.20 a week, them = $3.30 a week), and make it clear to the reader that our power bills are rising less than everyone else?

Global Warming???....Yet another Year 2000 bug money maker. What most people forget this is the first year of several rises. Also reading the fine print the price can be altered at anytime upwards not down.
Using www.cleanenergyfuture.gov.au you can get an idea with the calculator how much you will be ripped off.
Just as a laugh it says I am one of the top 900 richist people that will have to pay the full amount. My thoughts, another very expensive misleading money collection system to cover all the cost blowouts the Welsh import has made mistakes with.
