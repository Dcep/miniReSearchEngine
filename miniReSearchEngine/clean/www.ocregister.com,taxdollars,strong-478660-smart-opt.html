Electric bill skyrockets after smart meter; opt-out option coming, but will cost

The electric bill in January 2011 was
$150.23
, the usual cost of the monthly bill and typical for this small
Laguna Woods
home.
One year later, the bill was
$514.34
.
What could have possibly caused this
$364
increase  a leap of
243 percent?
A new state-of-the art
Jacuzzi
? Millions of holiday lights to rival
Disneyland
?
No,
Pat Wiseman
said. The only change to his parents' home was a new smart meter from the electric company,
Southern California Edison
. It had been installed at the end of October.
Smart meters are part of the new
Edison SmartConnect
grid. They connect to a secure wireless network that SCE says gives customers greater control to manage their usage  even from a cellphone, many miles from home. Smart meters are also read remotely, so employees don't have to trek to the house to read the meter.  By the end of this year,
5 million
smart meters are slated to be installed in Southern California. SCE is almost done installing them in Orange County  but there may soon be a way to opt out (at a price).
It was after his mother's smart meter was installed that Wiseman started seeing problems. Between Nov. 10 and Dec. 13, the usage for the
1,600
square-foot home was
62.4
kilowatt hours, he said. Between Dec. 13 and Jan. 12, it was
102.1
kilowatt hours.
Wiseman argues that there's no reason the consumption should have changed, because his mother's habits did not. She lives alone, spends most of her time in her bed, and has one
24-
hour care person with her. He lays the blame for the astounding increase squarely on the new meter.

When we first spoke to SCE, a spokesman said there is no way of telling if there are accuracy problems without examining  the individual usage of the consumer.  But the company said it has not had complaints about accuracy. Instead, he said, consumers say the new meters improve their ability to track their usage.
However, since December of 2008, the
California Public Utilities Commission
has received
946
complaints on SCE's smart meters, ranging from concern over health dangers to privacy and billing issues, to simply not wanting the smart meter at all.
The health issues people complain about include dizziness, nausea and headaches  symptoms some say are caused by the radio frequency (RF) radiation that the smart meters emit  as well as worries about being exposed to possible carcinogens.
SCE has compared the strength of smart meters' RF signals to other household devices, and says that a cellphone next to your ear emits a signal that's tremendously stronger than a smart meter
three
feet away (the cellphone signal being
4,960
microwatts per-centimeter-squared higher than the smart meter's, to be exact).
Due to the complaints and various citizen action groups banning together against smart meters, the state Public Utilities Commission will consider an opt-out proposal for consumers at its April 19 meeting.
The
proposal
was put forward March 15, and lays out the options on how to best institute an opt-out program, as well as the cost. Choosing to opt out will not be free of charge.
The Public Utilities Commission's
Division of Ratepayer Advocates
and the
Consumer Power Alliance
are pushing for an analog meter opt-out option, because that's what
Pacific Gas and Electric Co.
had to do for its customers in Northern California.
