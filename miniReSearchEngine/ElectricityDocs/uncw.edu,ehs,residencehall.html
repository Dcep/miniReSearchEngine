      <h1>Residence Hall Safety
      </h1>
      <p><span><strong>RESIDENCE</strong><strong> HALL-</strong><strong> FIRE EMERGENCY PROCEDURES</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>When you are alerted  by the fire alarm, shouted warnings, or the sensation of smoke or fire:</strong></p>
  
  <p>Feel the metal door knob before  opening any doors. If it is hot, don&rsquo;t  open the door. If it isn&rsquo;t, brace  yourself against the door, open it slightly; but if heat or heavy smoke is  present, close the door and stay in the room.</p>
  
  
  <p>If you can&rsquo;t leave the room, seal  up the cracks around the door using sheets or pieces of clothing. Then hang an object out the window (i.e., bed  sheet, jacket or shirt) to attract the attention of the fire department. Call University Police <span>(911)</span> or 962-2222 and report that  you are trapped. Be sure to give your  room number and location.</p>
  
  
  <p>Keep low to the floor if there is  smoke in the room.</p>
  
  
  <p>If you can leave the room, close  all doors and windows as you exit.</p>
  
  
  <p>Move quickly in a crouched position  to the nearest exit. <strong>DO NOT USE AN ELEVATOR.</strong> If the nearest exit is blocked by fire, heat  or smoke, go to another exit. Place a  wet towel or cloth over your head and face.  Breathe through the wet towel by taking short breaths through your  nose. Cover your body with something  that can be easily discarded if it catches on fire; also wear shoes.</p>
  
  
  <p>If all exits are blocked, go back</p>
  
  
  <p>Stand clear of the building after  evacuating. Go to your designated area  and help account for each person on your floor.</p>
  
  
  <p><strong>Never re-enter a  burning building for any reason</strong>  </p>
  <p><strong>CALL UNIVERSITY  POLICE - 911</strong></p>
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  <p><a name="Appliances" id="Appliances"></a>ELECTRICAL APPLIANCES</p>
  <p>
    The   electrical systems in the residence halls are not designed to carry heavy loads   of electrical equipment. The maximum capacity for each room is 1,000 watts.   Therefore, no single appliance should exceed 700 watts. Appliances that are   permitted include: microwaves, coffee pots, air popcorn poppers, hair dryers,   electric shavers, radios, TVs and stereos. Microwaves are permitted in student   rooms and must be .7 cu. ft. or smaller. Items, which are not allowed, include:   electric heaters, oil popcorn poppers, toaster ovens, and other open coiled or   open flame appliances. MICROWAVES ARE THE ONLY COOKING APPLIANCES ALLOWED IN THE   STUDENT ROOMS. Students living in the University Apartments may use toasters but   not toaster ovens. NO HOMEMADE ELECTRICAL APPLIANCE WILL BE PERMITTED. </p>
  <p>A student may bring or rent a refrigerator for their room. A   privately owned refrigerator 2.0 cu. ft. or less requires one $10.00   refrigerator decal; any privately-owned refrigerator over 2.0 cu. ft. requires   two $10.00 decals. A refrigerator cannot exceed 4.9 cu. ft. These decals may be   purchased during check-in or at the Office of Housing and Residence Life. </p>

<p><strong><a name="Outlets" id="Outlets"></a>ELECTRICAL OUTLETS</strong>  </p>
  <p>
    Use of   extension cords is permitted when only one item is plugged into it; however, you   may use more than one appliance on a circuit if you use breaker-protected,   multi-plug power strips. These may be purchased for under $15.00 at most   hardware and department stores. We also encourage you to use surge protectors on   all electronic equipment: TVs, VCRs, stereo equipment, CD players, etc. </p>
  <p>Go to: <a href="#Top">Top of Page</a></p>
  
  <p><strong><a name="Fire" id="Fire"></a>FIRE SAFETY</strong></p>
  <p>Candles, incense, oil lamps, etc. are not permitted in the   residence halls. These items produce an open flame or hotspot that produces   smoke. They may inadvertently set off the smoke alarm system causing a false   alarm. They may start a fire. Scented was warmers are allowed as long as they don't require an open flame. You are encouraged to bring irons and curling   irons that have an automatic turn off feature. Live Christmas trees are not   permitted in student rooms. No fireworks or gas grills are allowed in or around   any residence life area. Charcoal grills are not allowed on porches or   balconies, but may be used outside and at a safe distance from the building.   Motorized vehicles may not be parked at any location in or around the student   residences other than authorized parking lots/spaces. </p>
  <p>Walls of any residence life area may not be covered by cardboard   and no wall may have more than 50% of its total area covered by any material   including paper, cardboard, fabric, metal, etc. At no time may items cover life safety equipment such as sprinklerheads or smoke detectors. Items may not block doorways.</p>
  <p>Students are not allowed to bring halogen lamps to their room,   apartment or suite. Halogen lamps burn up to 10 times hotter than an ordinary   light bulb, causing a potential fire hazard. </p>
  <p>Keeping with university policy, residents in the University   Apartments and the University Suites should store nothing, including bicycles,   under any stairwell. </p>
  <p>Fire fighting, detection and alarm equipment is provided for the   protection of all residents. Misuse of, or tampering with, this equipment is a   violation of university regulations and state criminal statutes, and may result   in any one or combination of the following: immediate termination of the housing  license contract, university disciplinary action, and criminal fines and/or   imprisonment. Students are required by state law to evacuate a residence hall   when a fire alarm is activated or during other emergencies. </p>

<p><strong><a name="HazMat" id="HazMat"></a>HAZARDOUS MATERIALS</strong></p>
<p>Hazardous materials including, but not limited to, gas, propane,   chemicals, tiki torch fluid, gas grills are not permitted in on-campus housing under any   circumstances.</p>
<p>Go to: <a href="#Top">Top of Page</a></p>

<p><strong><a name="Pets" id="Pets"></a>PETS</strong></p>
<p>Because of public health regulations, pets are NOT permitted in   the residence halls, the University Apartments, University Suites, or Seahawk Village, Landing and Crossing under   any circumstances including brief visits or temporary stays. This applies to,   but is not limited to dogs, cats, birds, hamsters, snakes, mice and other   rodents. Fish in aquariums are permitted as long as the tank does not exceed 20   gallons and is kept in sanitary condition. A Health and Safety fine of at least   $25.00 is assessed to each student who possesses a pet in the student   residences. Residents will be assessed for the cost of extermination in any   rooms requiring pesticide for fleas caused by pets. Any pets found in violation   of this policy may be removed immediately and turned over to the Wilmington   Animal Control Center or the Humane Society. </p>

  <p><strong><a name="Smoking" id="Smoking"></a>SMOKING</strong></p>
  <p>University of North Carolina Wilmington is a smoke-free campus as   it applies to all academic, student support and residential buildings. This   means that smoking is not permitted in buildings at any time. Violators of the   smoke-free guidelines will be held accountable for their actions in the student   conduct system. </p>
  <p>All private (residential rooms, suites, apartments, bathrooms, and   computer labs) and public areas (main lobbies, common lounges, study rooms,   hallways, laundry facilities, and stairwells) in all residential facilities are   considered smoke-free. Resident students and their guests must smoke outside of   university-owned residential facilities at least 25 feet from any building entrance or air intake. Smoking materials must be properly disposed of in approved recepticles.</p>
  <p>Students found in violation of this policy will be fined at least   $25.00 for their first instance and at least $50.00 for each subsequent   violation. </p>
