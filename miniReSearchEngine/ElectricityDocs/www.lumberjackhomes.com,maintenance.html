                <H3>From Texas A&amp;M University - Charles L. Stayton, James V. 
				Robinson, and Philip Hamman*</H3>
                <p class="MsoNormal"><b>Log homes</b> are becoming popular again 
				in the South. In the late 1800's more than 50 percent of all 
				dwellings were constructed of logs. But by the mid-1930's wood 
				siding homes had become the norm, with less than 1 percent of 
				new homes constructed of logs. Wood siding homes usually were 
				better constructed because they were built to be permanent 
				rather than temporary. </p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">Today, home builders are discovering that 
				log homes can provide attractive, long-lasting shelter, but that 
				they also can have insect, wood rot and exterior finishing 
				problems if improperly constructed and maintained Also, heating 
				and cooling costs can be higher for log homes as compared to 
				conventional homes. To be assured of satisfaction with the final 
				product, potential log homeowners should be aware of possible 
				problems so that they can be prevented. </p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><b>ENERGY EFFICIENCY</b></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">Energy efficiency depends upon using thick 
				logs with airtight construction. How thick the logs need to be 
				is debatable. Wood has an average R-value of about 1.25 per 
				inch. Theoretically, if a log home is to match the energy 
				efficiency of a conventional home with a wall R-value of 12, 
				logs need to be about 9-<font face="Verdana">½</font> inches 
				thick. Research suggests that this theoretical log size can be 
				reduced to about 8 inches because of the log wall mass. However, 
				actual comparisons in East Texas are showing that machined log 
				walls 5-<font face="Verdana">½</font> inches thick provide 
				energy efficiency equal to or better than conventional 2x4 stud 
				wall construction. </p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">If the above data remain consistent, log 
				thickness beyond 51/2 inches may not be economical. Increasing 
				log size from 5-<font face="Verdana">½</font> to 7-<font face="Verdana">½</font> 
				inches adds about $2,300 to the cost of a 2,000-square-foot 
				home. If the same $2,300 were invested at 7 percent annual 
				compound interest for 7 years, the increased log size would have 
				to reduce monthly heating and cooling costs by $44 to equal the 
				investment return. </p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">Extreme climates may require a minimum log 
				size of 7-<font face="Verdana">½</font> inches or larger. More 
				data on comparisons by geographical areas are needed to 
				establish minimum log sizes. It is becoming obvious, however, 
				that properly built log homes' are certainly equal to 
				conventionally built homes, even when conventional homes have 
				polyethylene film barriers to reduce air turnover rates. The 
				National Bureau of Standards' recent study clearly shows this.
				</p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">Proper construction is critical for log 
				home energy efficiency just as it is for conventional homes. Two 
				common construction errors may account for some of the poor 
				energy performance, which commonly occurs with, log homes. Most 
				of the energy loss in a home is through the ceiling, not the 
				walls. Log homes without conventional roof systems may not have 
				adequate attic space to allow for proper insulation. And 
				incorrect construction, with green logs, can create tremendous 
				air turnover rates. </p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">Airtight construction is best achieved and 
				maintained by using machined logs rather than natural, round 
				ones. Machined logs make possible tighter joints between logs 
				and between log ends and doors and windows. Tighter joints are 
				more easily sealed against air leakage, thus reducing the air 
				turnover rate and heating and cooling costs. A highly elastic, 
				tightly bonding caulking, such as polyurethane, is the best 
				choice for sealing joints because logs will continue to shrink 
				and swell. It is important to periodically check all sealed 
				joints for air leakage and to reseal any reopened joints. </p>

				<p class="MsoNormal"><b>PREVENTING WOOD ROT AND INSECT DAMAGE</b></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">Proper building practices and good log 
				quality control must be adhered to in order to prevent wood rot 
				and insect damage. These problems can lead to costly repairs for 
				the homeowner. </p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Proper Building Practices</b></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">A log home must be designed and constructed 
				to prevent both rain and ground moisture accumulation and, 
				excessive shrinkage. Logs should be dry (below 20 percent 
				moisture content) before building. Wood shrinks as it dries, 
				causing cracking, splitting and warping. An 8 foot high wall 
				built with fresh cut logs can settle 3 to 4 inches because of 
				shrinkage. Unless a log home is designed to allow for such 
				shrinkage, structural failure and rain and air seepage can 
				occur. Structural failures lead to costly repairs; air seepage 
				increases energy costs; and rain seepage causes wood decay. </p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">Moisture problems that cause log decay are 
				related to careless workmanship and poor design and maintenance. 
				They usually can be eliminated by properly designing and 
				constructing the foundation, walls and roof. Good drainage is 
				essential to a dry foundation and must be considered in the 
				initial planning. The building site should be graded or ditched 
				so rainwater drains away from the home. </p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">Stone and concrete foundations or piers 
				that keep untreated logs 12 to 18 inches above the ground are 
				highly recommended. The crawl space created by foundations or 
				piers should be properly ventilated and screened to keep out 
				animals. Open crawl spaces or those enclosed with screen or 
				latticework usually are adequately ventilated. Solid foundation 
				walls should have properly sized vents to allow adequate air 
				circulation in the crawl space. </p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">Vent openings within10 feet of the corners 
				usually give the best cross ventilation. The size and number of 
				openings should be based on soil moisture, atmospheric humidity 
				and air movement. In general, the total area of all ventilation 
				openings should, be equivalent to 1/150 of the ground area 
				beneath the dwelling. Keep shrubbery far enough away from 
				foundation walls that it will not restrict air movement through 
				ventilator openings. If the crawl space under the building is 
				frequently damp, the soil should be covered with heavy grade 
				polyethylene plastic sheeting (at least 6 millimeters thick) so 
				that soil moisture will not evaporate and condense on the wood 
				sub flooring and log walls. The soil should be treated for 
				subterranean termites before the plastic ground cover is put 
				down. </p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">Untreated logs placed on slab on ground 
				foundations are highly susceptible to decay without proper slab 
				design and log maintenance. The slab top should be no less than 
				6 inches (preferably 8 inches) above the ground to maintain the 
				required minimum 6 inches above ground for the first log. Logs 
				should be treated periodically with a total wood preservative 
				(Preservatives are, discussed under exterior log finishing). A 
				vapor barrier, consisting, of a heavy grade polyethylene plastic 
				sheet with a minimum rating of <font face="Verdana">½</font> 
				perm should be used under the, concrete slab. Joints should be 
				lapped at least 4 inches and sealed. Logs placed on slab 
				foundations also can be protected by covered porches. However, 
				when exposed logs are closer than 6 inches to the ground, the 
				first three bottom logs should be pressure treated with 
				chromated copper arsenate (CCA). </p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">Log cabin walls window and doorframes must 
				be carefully constructed to avoid forming crevices where water 
				can accumulate and soak into the wood. Fittings should be made 
				tight and protected by polyurethane caulking. Rainwater does not 
				normally cause serious decay damage if it can quickly run off. 
				But water trapped in joints, crevices or cracks can cause decay. 
				During construction major cracks or checks in logs should be 
				turned downward or caulked so that they will not trap water. 
				Joints between logs also must be caulked. </p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">Proper roof construction helps prevent wood 
				decay in walls, foundations, doors, and windows. The roof, 
				overhang should not be less than 18 inches (preferably 24 
				inches) for a one story home and 24 inches (preferably 36 inches 
				for a two story. </p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">Wider overhangs are particularly desirable 
				in areas of higher rainfall, such as along the Gulf Coast. The 
				greater the roof pitch and overhang, the farther away from the 
				structure the rainwater is projected, thus protecting the walls 
				from wetting. Roof supporting logs, timbers or sawn lumber 
				should not extend beyond the eaves where they can become wet and 
				are quickly attacked by wood decay. </p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">Termite protection is best achieved by 
				treating the soil around both sides of foundation walls, around 
				piers and utility entrances, and under the foundation slab prior 
				to or during construction. An EPA registered termitecide should 
				be used. Both slab on ground and pier and beam foundations 
				require this soil treatment. Consult with qualified pest control 
				operators who supply termite treatment services. For more 
				information, your county Extension agent can supply publications 
				on subterranean termites and on selecting a termite control 
				service. </p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Log Quality Control</b></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">In order to produce, good quality logs, the 
				effects of insects, and decay causing fungi must be minimized, 
				during log harvesting, drying, machining, transit and 
				construction. Many problems with decay and insects can be 
				eliminated by using logs soon after they are cut and by 
				protecting them during seasoning and storage. Logs should be 
				removed from the woods immediately and debarked. In a southern 
				climate, dead timber used for logs should be harvested no later 
				than 3 to 4 months after trees die. Extensive, damage from decay 
				and insects can occur while the tree is standing, and salvaged 
				logs should be inspected carefully for borer activity as they 
				are peeled. Insects and decay problems are less likely to occur 
				if healthy trees and logs are cut in late fall or winter and 
				used promptly. </p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">Leaving the bark on logs restricts drying 
				and preservative treatments and attracts some insects. Sawyers, 
				metallic borers and ambrosia beetles can attack log bark and 
				sapwood immediately after trees are cut. However, old house 
				borers and powderpost beetles prefer debarked logs. Treating 
				logs with preservative immediately after debarking and prior to 
				drying will help prevent attack by these insects. Preservative 
				treatment involves dipping the logs in copper 8 quinolinolate or 
				zinc naphthenate solutions and storing them 18 inches off the 
				ground, preferably under­ a roof to air-dry. This treatment will 
				protect the logs from some insects and stain fungi while drying, 
				but does not provide permanent protection. Logs stored for 
				drying during warm weather should be sprayed with an EPA­ 
				registered insecticide containing linclane or chlorpyrifos to 
				prevent infestation by certain wood boring insects. Logs also 
				can be kiln dried after debarking rather than air-dried. High 
				kiln temperatures usually kill any insect larvae and decay fungi 
				present. Whether logs are air or kiln dried, their final 
				moisture content should be below 20 percent to prevent, wood 
				decay. </p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">Pressure preservative treatment of logs 
				after they are dried and machined protects them completely from 
				decay and insect damage during transit, storage, construction 
				and there after. The recommended preservative for treating both 
				interior and exterior wood is CCA. CCA treatment colors logs 
				grayish green, but this cart be masked by applying pigmented 
				wood preservative. Logs that are not pressure preservative 
				treated should receive another dipping in copper 8 quinolinolate 
				or zinc naphthenate after machining. This provides some 
				protection from decay and insects during transit, storage and 
				construction. After construction, the exterior log surfaces must 
				be sprayed or brushed periodically with a wood preservative that 
				contains an effective water repellent. Logs should be inspected 
				annually, and any new, large checks or cracks should be caulked 
				with a polyurethane caulking compound. </p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Exterior Log Finishing </b></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">Most people who purchase or build log homes 
				want them to continue to look just like they did when first 
				built. Unfortunately, this will not happen without continual 
				maintenance. An important part of maintenance is the application 
				of a finish to exterior logs. </p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">Finish information recommendations are 
				based on tests performed primarily in East Texas. The opinions 
				given should in no way be interpreted as an official endorsement 
				by the Texas Agricultural Extension Service or the Texas Forest 
				Service, both of the Texas A&amp;M University System. </p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">(CCA pressure-treated logs can be finished 
				after they have weathered for 6 months in an exposed location or 
				1 year in a protected location such as under a covered porch.)
				</p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">The finish should protect against 
				weathering (sunlight and rain), decay and mildew. (CCA treatment 
				protects logs from decay, but not mildew.) The finish also must 
				contain a pigment if the homeowner wishes to maintain the 
				original wood color or mask the greenish color of CCA treatment.
				</p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">Weathering tests conducted by the Texas 
				Forest Service's Forest Products Laboratory show that most wood 
				stains, water repellents and preservative last only 7 to 18 
				months before mildew or weathering begins. Most log homeowners 
				report that they are refinishing annually to maintain the 
				original wood color. </p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">One product tested In Texas and Missouri 
				has proved effective in controlling both weathering and mildew. 
				It is TWP (Total Wood Preservative). TWP contains both a 
				fungicide and a mildewcide, as well as a pigment, resin, 
				ultraviolet light absorber and water repellent. The TWP finish 
				lasts about 5 years and may be the best way of maintaining an 
				attractive natural wood look. </p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">Seal Treat II is another product that gives 
				a long-lasting finish. However, it is only available in a clear, 
				ready-to-use solution and is not effective in maintaining the 
				original color of wood. Wood treated with Seal Treat 11 weathers 
				to a pleasing ash white color. This product controls mildew 
				well. </p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">Sikkens, a product that must be applied in 
				multiple coats, has shown acceptable results for shorter periods 
				or time. It tends to break down under ultraviolet light within 2 
				to 3 years, and does not protect against mildew for very long in 
				hot, humid climates. Although the initial cost of Sikkens is 
				high when compared to other products, its coverage rate tends to 
				compensate for the cost difference. </p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Controlling Decay and Insects in 
				Existing Log Homes</b></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">Owners of log homes often experience wood 
				decay and insect problems. The most common insect problems are 
				caused by beetles, which attack the wood within days after trees 
				are felled or as logs are dried, machined or transported. These 
				beetles include: the metallic wood-boring beetles sometimes 
				referred to as flatheaded borers; long-horned wood-boring 
				beetles or round headed borers; ambrosia beetles and pin-hole 
				borers, and powderpost beetles and old house borers. </p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">The beetle larvae most often found, in 
				homes constructed of softwood logs are metallic wood-boring 
				beetles. The adults lay eggs in bark cracks and crevices of 
				unseasoned logs. The larvae feed deeper into logs as the wood 
				gets drier, and emerge as adults within I to 5 years after house 
				construction. The <font face="Verdana">¼</font> inch to
				<font face="Verdana">&#8540;</font> inch oval holes they leave upon 
				emerging can trap water in the insect tunnels, causing decay. 
				These emergence holes should be sealed with polyurethane 
				caulking. No treatment for these beetles is required. </p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">Powderpost beetles and old house borers 
				infest wood after debarking and during seasoning, storage, 
				transit or construction. The adults emerge 3 or more years later 
				and can then re-infest the wood. Therefore, emerging beetles 
				must be identified so that an appropriate control method can be 
				used. These methods include spraying or injecting the logs with 
				an EPA registered insecticide, or in certain cases fumigating 
				logs under a gas-tight tarpaulin. Both of these control methods 
				will require the services of a certified pest control operator
				</p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">Subterranean termites can pose a serious 
				threat to log homes; that is why homeowners are strongly advised 
				to have the soil properly treated prior to or during 
				construction. If termites attack logs after the home is built, 
				the, damage can result in substantial labor and repair costs. 
				Also, it is much more expensive and difficult to treat the soil 
				under an existing slab. The log home should be inspected 
				annually for any sign of termite damage, and the damage 
				controlled before it becomes extensive. </p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">For more information on insects which 
				attack wood, obtain Extension publications on subterranean and 
				dry wood termites, wood destroying beetles, carpenter ants and 
				carpenter bees from your county Extension agent. </p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">Most structural damage to log homes is 
				caused by wood decay rather than by insects. Wood decay is 
				caused by excess moisture, and can be prevented by protecting 
				wood from moisture. CCA pressure treated wood must be used to 
				replace any rotting wood. </p>
