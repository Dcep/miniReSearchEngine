        <p class="style17"><b>By: Devvy<br> August<b> 15</b>, 2011</b></p>
        <p class="style17">Despite the fact that I try
  to keep up with the massive assault against we the people by the Outlaw
  Congress and too many new laws coming out of our state legislatures, no
  one can keep up with everything. Which is why I had only read a little
  here and there about something called 'smart meters'. Then, of course,
  the problem came knocking at my door.</p>
        <p class="style17"> On April 18, 2011, I
          received a letter from Reliant Energy there was a repeat problem with
          the meter reader having access to my property. I have locks on both
          gates because I have dogs. Last year, some punk opened one of the gates
          during the night and my beloved Mr. Willy got out; the locks went on
          the same day. I was unaware the meter reader was having trouble since
          my husband is always home due to his serious health problems. If he has
          to go to the doctor, I'm here. What also waved a red flag was Reliant's
          letter which stated I am required to have one of their new 'smart
          meters' installed. </p>
        <p class="style17"> So, I call Reliant and they
          referred me to a company called ONCOR, a TDSP (Transmission and
          Distribution Service Provider). Dialing away, I call ONCOR's customer
          service rep and explain the situation. I also told the lady there is
          someone at this house every day; either John or myself. All their meter
          reader has to do is knock on the door and he can read the meter. I
          thought that was the end of the matter until one day a nice young man
          showed up at the door to let me know he was going to install a 'smart
          meter'. I politely said, no you aren't; he left.</p>
        <p class="style17"> By that time I had done
          some research that was beyond alarming. In early July, while I was gone
          running errands, another ONCOR fellow showed up at the door to install
          a 'smart meter'. My husband said, no we will not have one of those
          dangerous things attached to our house. The ONCOR installer informed
          John that if we didn't agree to have it installed, ONCOR would shut off
          our power with no notice. On July 12, 2011, I sent both Reliant and
          ONCOR a certified letter in which I explained my husband has serious
          medical problems and depends on oxygen during the day and a machine at
          night to keep his heart from stopping. If they shut off the power, it
          could have dire consequences. He is also a cancer survivor, all the
          more reason not to have one of those dangerous meters on our house.</p>
        <p class="style17"> On July 22, 2011, I
          received a letter from ONCOR. They would shut off the power if I didn't
          agree to have the meter installed. Their letter was also very
          deceptive. In paragraph 2, it states, &#8220;The
          EPAct further requires states to
          consider the adoption of Smart Metering...&#8221; </p>
        <p
 align="justify" class="style17">'Consider'
          does not mean mandatory. In fact, there is no mandatory requirement
          by the Federal Government from any quarter because I looked up every
          reference resource in their letter.</p>
        <p
 align="justify" class="style17">Referring
          again to their letter, they state: &#8220;...when the Texas Legislature
          passed a law (H.B. No 2129) encouraging the deployment of new
          advanced meters...&#8221; no where does it state mandatory installation
          in residences throughout the State of Texas. It says 'encouraging' and
          it all has to do with federal bribe money to the states. Surprise,
          surprise.. </p>
        <p
 align="justify" class="style17">ONCOR
          further cites in their July 20, 2011 letter Section 8 &amp; 9 of H.B.
          2129. However, they did not provide the entire bill, only the
          sections they thought would benefit their agenda. I looked up the
          entire enrolled bill signed into law, there is no
          mandatory requirement for forced installation of a 'smart meter' in
          households. <br></p>
        <p class="style17">The
          letter concluded with &#8220;Please allow the AMS meter to be installed
          at your property, since failure to provide access may result in
          suspension of delivery service.&#8221;</p>
        <p class="style17"> On July 26, 2011, I had a quick meeting with the County Judge here in
          my town. I had prepared a sworn affidavit as well as exhibits and was
          seeking a TRO (Temporary Restraining Order) to keep ONCOR from turning
          off my power. Judge Barr said he had no jurisdiction, try the District
          Judge across the street. Trek across the street only to be told the one
          and only District Judge is in a jury trial for a week or more. Rural
          Texas. That's when I went home and called a state representative I have
          been working with on another project; he's a lawyer when not in
          session. I'll get back to this shortly.</p>
        <p class="style17"> You might ask what is my objection
          to a 'smart meter'? Which one would that be? Health concerns or
          privacy? Both, actually. As I said I knew little about this new
          technology, so about 100 hours of research later and thanks to so many
          dedicated people fighting this, here are some of the known problems at
          this time:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="style17">"Those
            wireless meters on every home and building will emit huge pulses of
            microwave radio frequency radiation as often as every few seconds
            throughout the day and night, seven days a week. Our FCC exposure
            standards only cover short-term thermal (heating) effects; they do
            not cover long-term accumulative exposure, nor do they cover
            biological impacts.&quot;</p>
          <p class="style17">"The
            World Health Organization has recently classified the type of
            radiation emitted from smart meters (non-ionizing radiation) as a
            Class 2B carcinogen, on par with lead.&quot;<br></p>
          <p align="justify" class="style17">"All
            transmitters inside your home or office will communicate with a Smart
            Meter attached to the outside of each building. That meter, in turn,
            will transmit at an even higher frequency to a central hub installed
            in local neighborhoods.&quot;</p>
          <p align="left" class="style17">"In
            what are called &#8220;mesh networks,&#8221; signals can also be bounced from
            house-meter to house-meter before reaching the final hub. So
            exposures will not just be from your own meter, but accumulating from
            possibly 100-to-500 of your neighbors&#8217; as well.&quot;</p>
          <p> <span class="style17">"The
            scientific evidence for biological impacts from microwave radiation,
            known for decades (remember the Moscow embassy) continues to grow
            with impacts such as DNA damage, increased risk of cancers and
            tumors, cellular stress, decreased melatonin, decreased sperm,
            cognitive difficulties and brain-wave alteration, heart rhythm
            disturbances, red blood cell clumping, and impacts on wildlife
            including to bees.</span>&quot;</p>
          <p> <span class="style17">"Wireless radio-frequency radiation from
            smart meters can cause medical devices to stop working. Medical
            implants such as pacemakers and deep-brain stimulators used to
            control the shaking of Parkinson&#8217;s disease can be turned off by the
            radio frequency interference (RFI) caused by the signal. These
            signals are reported in published studies to interfere with critical
            care equipment, ventilators, pain pumps, wireless insulin pumps and
            other medical devices.</span>&quot;</p>
          <p> <span class="style17">"Reports from those who have had meters
            installed include heart palpitations, dizziness, inability to fall
            asleep, memory problems and cognitive disturbances, flu-like
            symptoms, worsening of existing health problems, abrupt depression,
            agitation, headaches, hearing problems.</span>&quot;</p>

                      just a tiny sample of what experts have to say about wireless radio
                      frequency and radiation. A few days ago someone I do business with here
                      in my town mentioned her mother recently had a medical emergency and
                      had to go 50 miles to Odessa to see the doctor; she just didn't feel
                      good for a few days and then her blood pressure spiked dangerously. I
                      inquired if she knew if her mother had a 'smart meter' on her house.
                      Traci looked surprised and said, yes just recently, why? I then gave
                      her a good overview of the problem, told her to get her mother to
                      document what happened, write a snail mail letter to Rep. Landtroop and
                      mail it to his district office, not Austin. A few thousand letters will
                      get your state representative's attention.</p>
        <p class="style17">As for
                      privacy, do you know there are companies out there already harvesting
                      your personal data <span style="font-style: italic;">without oversight</span> if you have one of those 'smart meters'? No, it's not a conspiracy

        <blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <p class="style17">"That data
              shows when you are at home, shows when you are sleeping, shows when you
              are on vacation, when you have visitors, when you use a lamp, a power
              tool, some extra computers, and if you look like you're running a
              business out of your home. It even senses when you bootleg energy off
              the grid.</p>

                  is a search without a warrant every day. This is your personal private

                  from the side of your house. Yes, smart meters are radio transmitters
                  licensed by the FCC. On this all-news radio station, every detail of
                  your electrical life is shooting off to some institutional data center
                  somewhere. Already, the police in Ohio, Texas, British Columbia, and
                  places I don't know about, are regularly using smart meter data to
                  pinpoint marijuana grow houses, enforce business licenses, and punish
                  people for doing things in the privacy of their own homes, that you are
                  not supposed to do, that they would not even know that you were doing,

          at the expense of human health, not to mention all this 'dirty energy'
          and what it does to livestock consumed by humans and to the
          environment. The only ones to benefit from 'smart meters' will be
          attorneys (lawsuits), utility companies and big pharmaceutical

          pills.<br></p>
        <p class="style17">The 'smart
          meter' is an intregal part of something called the 'smart grid'.
          Because of copyright issues, I can't scan the pages sent to me by a
          fellow Texan in an email. Try to get a copy (or check your local
          library) of the Spring 2011 <span style="font-style: italic;">Industry
            Week Magazin</span>e. There is a huge article on the smart grid and all
          about "controlling energy inside the consumer space" using real time.
          That's you and me. Control us. It discusses the need to "change
          attitudes". That means brain wash people into 'compliance' on how much
          energy you will be <span style="font-style: italic;">allowed</span> to
          use and if you go over, think "they" won't shut off an appliance? Think
          again because the utility company controlling those meters can and
          will. That's the whole idea behind the so called "smart grid".</p>
        <p class="style17">Reading
          the pages my email friend sent from <span style="font-style: italic;">Industry
            Week</span> was literally frightening. What also made me want to vomit
          is how proud those in the industry are in planning how to control all
          of us. Are they that stupid? I guess they don't mind being a guinea pig
          with their every movement inside their own home tracked and recorded
          and sold to third parties.</p>
        <p class="style17">If you
          think the outlaws in Congress want total control, you haven't seen
          anything yet until you understand what's going on in the field of
          energy, utility companies and companies who make and provide technology
          for them. Privacy? If we don't fight back against this 'smart meter'
          'smart grid' now, today, you won't have any privacy left. We will
          literally be forced into a world of constant surveillance because
          that's EXACTLY what 'smart meters' are -&nbsp; real time surveillance
          of you and what goes on in your house without a search warrant.</p>
        <p class="style17">Where do
          things stand right now? I guess you can call it a stand off for the
          moment. I've had no more visits from ONCOR nor has anyone come to read
          the meter. If they knock on the door and request to read the meter, I
          will unlock the gate and accompany them and watch while they read the
          meter to make sure the fellow doesn't try to pull a fast one and
          install a 'smart meter' while I'm in the house. Nice way to live.
          Playing games to keep a dangerous device from being attached right
          outside our bedroom window.</p>
        <p class="style17">The state
          representative I mentioned earlier in this column contacted my new
          state rep. They both have tried to contact ONCOR, but that upstanding
          company won't return their calls. I've also retained legal counsel to
          get a hearing in front of the Texas Public Utility Commission. When I
          spoke with my state representative last week, Jim Landtroop, he
          indicated they could also do something with the TPUC. </p>
        <p class="style17"> I have received dozens of emails from people telling me I only need put
          a sign up on my fence that says do not install a smart meter or send
          ONCOR a certified letter. Well, here is the reality of the situation:
          they can turn off your power without notice regardless of how many
          signs you post on your house. Read the fine print in your contract with
          your utility carrier. Likely you'll find language that says when you
          sign up with them you give their company permission to enter your
          property for maintenance and installation of their technology. A nice
          man contacted me to let me know that for $299.00 people can purchase a
          'kit' to block part of the 'smart meter'. We live on a fixed income.
          Why should I have to shell out $299.00 to deface or tamper with ONCOR's
          equipment? I guarantee you, the utility companies are going to find out
          and will be at your front door with a big, fat bill. They could claim
          your interference with their equipment knocked out 34 refrigerators in
          the area and caused a gazillion dollars in damage. Want to deal with
          that?</p>
        <p class="style17"> All this research and discussions with state representatives and my
          attorney have eaten a massive amount of my time, but time I have had to
          spend. Make no mistake -- there is a major war going on all across this
          country over those meters even though there is nothing in the MSM or
          cable networks like FAUX. In California, ten counties have banned them,
          but PG &amp; E doesn't care, they're installing them anyway. Folks in
          one county were arrested for trying to hold their ground and keep PG
          &amp; E from installing them. This is America? The sheriff accompanies
          utility workers to force dangerous devices on people's homes!</p>
        <p class="style17"> Last year there was a huge uproar in the Dallas area because those
          meters do not read accurately and people's utility bills were double
          and triple. There are many news items from around Texas about houses
          catching on fire during the night because of the problems with wiring.
          I could fill a thousand pages on this, but mark my words: This is a war
          because it involves billions and billions of dollars. Oh, one other
          little thing: Good bye tens of thousands of meter reader jobs. It will
          all be done from a remote location. Humans need not apply for a job.</p>
        <p class="style17"><a
 href="http://www.skeltontaintorabbott.net/news/85/77/Skelton-Taintor-Abbott-Wins-Landmark-Smart-Meter-Case.html">There
          was a major landmark case decided in May of this year. </a>A group of
          folks out in Maine hired an energy attorney to represent them in front
          of the Maine PUC. They won. Utility companies in Maine must give
          customers the opportunity to opt out of having one of those dangerous
          meters installed on their home. A blow to the money grubbers for their
          'smart meter' scheme. Those citizens did it the right way by pooling
          their money as a group to hire a good lawyer. Had they lost, could they
          file a lawsuit? Yes, but we all know how costly that is and <span
 style="font-style: italic;">we the people should not have to spend our
            hard earned money fighting utility companies for jumping the gun
            regarding health issues for profit. </span></p>
        <p class="style17">Legally, I
          don't need an attorney to bring my case to the Texas PUC for a hearing.
          But, in reality, I do need one because I need him to protect my rights
          because he knows the law and knows how to proceed on something like
          this, I don't. Each and every ruling will have an impact on the rest of
          the country, which is why we have to proceed as quickly as we can, but
          not risk getting bad decisions on the books. Right now, Maine's PUC
          issued a land mark ruling. We can do it in all the states.</p>
        <p class="style17">For those
          who have the 'smart meter' on your house, if you have any ill health
          effects, document them in detail. Contact your state representative and
          provide him/her (snail mail) with facts. The links below represent
          expert opinions you can print out and include. It doesn't matter if
          your legislature is out of session. Ours is until January 2013, but my
          state representative is on this and if you do the same in your state, I
          am confident we will see more legislators step up to the plate. At the
          end of your letter, ask your state rep if he/she wants one of those
          surveillance meters on their house and the data sold to outside third
          parties without your permission? <span style="font-style: italic;">Ask
            them if they want something so dangerous next to him/her and their
            family?</span></p>
        <p class="style17">If you
          live in the State of Texas, I hope you will contact me. Whether you
          have the meter yet or not, it is better to have many complainants to
          the TPUC and also help to pay the attorney I have retained. I'm doing
          all the research to help cut down on billable hours, but even though
          Tommy is a friend, he cannot work for free. If a few dozen of us share
          the cost of legal counsel, get this in front of the PUC and prevail, we
          help all Texans as well as other states.</p>
        <p class="style17">I don't
          just want the TPUC to issue a ruling that says we have the right to opt
          out, I want them (if they have the legal authority) to order ONCOR and
          other companies in Texas who install those meters to remove them at <span
 style="font-style: italic;">their</span> cost and reinstall the old
          analog meters that work just fine. Because companies like ONCOR have,
          without your permission, subjected their customers to a dangerous piece
          of technology and literally are conducting wire tapping on your
          residence, THEY, not the customer should bear the cost of replacement.
          We'll also see what our state legislatures can do about those who have
          the meters and want them removed with the utility companies rightfully
          paying the cost. A major war and you can bet the big money will come
          out with batteries of attorneys and lobbyists to fight the legislatures.</p>
        <p class="style17">What
          happens if the Texas PUC says no? Then, we go to the next step which
          might involve a lawsuit. However, and this is where legal counsel is so
          important: A lawsuit was filed here in Texas last year pro se, but was
          kicked to the curb. I believe we have to start at the administrative
          level first and that is your state PUC. And -- your state
          representative. All state legislatures can call an emergency session.
          Here in Texas, the vile political animal and globalist, Gov. Rick
          Perry, issued an Executive Order in 2007 to force all young girls in
          this state to take the deadly cocktail known as the HPV vaccine. Our
          legislature held an emergency session and over rode his EO. I know
          everyone is so buried in this fire and that, but the health of you and
          your family is top priority and this can't wait. </p>
        <p class="style17">Again, if you live in Texas and want to
          join with me, please send me email: <a href="mailto:devvyk@earthlink.net">devvyk@earthlink.net</a><br></p>
        <p class="style17">Please
          share this column with your mailing lists, family and friends because
          those dangerous smart meters are now on the houses of millions of
          Americans with more than one hundred million houses and apartments
          buildings to go, as well as all retail and commercial buildings in the
          entire country. Time is of the essence because as I said, this involves
          big money and big plans by people who do not care the least about our
          health and privacy. Only bigger profits at our expense. I refuse to be
          used as a guinea pig, but my whole neighborhood has those smart meters.
          The readings gather from house to house to house as they make their way
          to the data collection point, so we are still getting some of it. My
          husband's hearing aid has been going haywire the last six months. I
          believe it's because of all the 'smart' meters in my neighborhood.<br> </p>
        <p class="style17">There are
          dozens of very good web sites on the 'smart meter'. It has taken so
          much time to go through them. This one is very good: </p>

        <p class="style17">The
          documents below are the exhibits for my attorney; you can use them,
          too. I know it's a lot of printing, but a few are going on a CD because
          they are 50 to 100 pages. However, it's is critically important to be
          well prepared because there are reports and analysis going to some of
          the PUC's in states like California written by individuals and/or firms
          who receive funding from the utility companies. In other words,
          conflict of interest. All those reports claim there are no health risks
          from 'smart meters'. The same claims were made a decade ago about cell
          phones and now people around the world know different. </p>
        <p class="style17">We all owe
          a debt of gratitude to the individuals below for putting so much time
          into their reports and assessments and making them available on line so
          we have the ammunition to fight the powerful utility companies.</p>
