It's got a table on the front listing the various things that can be cooked automatically using the built-in programs.<br />

To start it normally, you have to select among 5 power levels, then select the duration. We frequently use levels 5 (max), 4 and 3.</div></div><hr />

I do that with the baby's food.  I'm never sure whether 1 minute at 50% is really any different from 30 seconds at full power, though.  <br />

Ditto. Additionally, I use lower setting when making rice or oatmeal (full power initially, and then lower power to cook).</div></div><hr />

<br />
That sounds like CYA language to me. The popcorn companies realize that there are people out there who will just throw the bag in, push the button, and leave it, when in fact, it isn't that precise and needs to be monitored. I use the popcorn button on my microwave and there is usually at least 30 seconds left when I take it out, well long enough to burn it if left for the complete cycle.<br />
<br />
As for the OP, in addition to full power, defrost, and popcorn, I use the reheat settings, the potato setting, and I experiment with various power levels to avoid overcooking the edges of things.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Amateur Barbarian</div><div class="date">04-25-2014, 01:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Microwaves vary considerably in power. If you have something other than a $50 Wal*mart dorm-room special, it probably has more power than a little box.<br />
<br />
I frequently use longer times at 50% power on things that are not entirely liquid. All or mostly water? Zap it at full power. Soup, chili or vegetables? They'll cook much better, with no dried edges, hot spots, boiling over and spattering at half power. You need to give the water-borne heat time to spread through the denser materials without boiling spots. I have other power levels I've learned to use with specific tasks and items. I'd have to relearn them with a new oven, even one of the same approximate power.<br />
<br />
But other than that, and the 30-seconds-per-press quickstart, I don't think I've ever used a microwave preset. They're kind of the successor to &quot;18-speed blenders&quot; and the like. Can't think of a time I've tried one and it worked satisfactorily.</div></div><hr />

That's the one I have at home. At work I use it at 100% (for less time) because A) there are other people using it at work besides me, B) I have more of a time constraint when I'm having lunch at work than I generally do when I'm at home, and C) the one where I work right now has a messed up display which makes it pretty hard to read. Set time and &quot;Start&quot; is all I bother to do with that one.</div></div><hr />

I have other power levels I've learned to use with specific tasks and items.This is my method as well.  When reheating lunch at work or leftovers from last night, even most soup or chili, two minutes at 50% is usually just right.  If it is particularly liquidy or something like a cup of coffee, max power.  I'm also fairly strict on covering the food with a glass or porcelain bowl and letting it sit for a bit after the two minutes.  If the bowl is hot to the touch when time's up, the food is probably ready.</div></div><hr />

It works wonderfully, I don't know how it does it. It's like a little white magic box in my kitchen. It doesn't have some pre-set time for things like frozen dinners; it seems to sense a certain amount of steam or something, and doesn't put a time on the display until it &quot;knows&quot; there's 1 or 2 minutes remaining, it's always different (but the same for the same dinners). <br />

Think about your regular oven - 350 degrees is the most commonly used temp and that is considered to be medium heat.  You wouldn't reheat leftovers at 500 degrees in your oven, so don't reheat them at full power in your microwave either.  <br />
<br />
I only use full power if I have a frozen something and the instructions on the package say to do so, OR if I'm cooking something from a raw state and not simply reheating.<br />

Anyway, I ended up getting one as an adult in the 90s.  Cooking?  Ha!  Couldn't do jack with the things.  I've only ever used them for simply nuking the crap out of stuff.  Well, that's not entirely true - I've tried defrosting a few times, but it never seems to work.  I got burnt bits and still-frozen bits.  Nuking to heat stuff?  They are brilliant.  Anything else?  I'll use the stove top.</div></div><hr />

I have a 1250-watt microwave, so when I'm cooking something with directions written for the standard 1100-watt models, I'll drop to 80% power. I've also used lower settings for tasks like softening butter. I don't normally use defrost because I dislike the results.<br />
